/*
 * dprl - This subroutine provides an interface to the
 *        readline library for the Dataplot program.
 *        It is adapted from the "rl.c" and "histexamp.c"
 *        programs.
 *
 *        We use readline in a basic way (just to get command line
 *        editing and history recall).  We do not add any custom
 *        features.  Also, we are only interested in supporting standard
 *        input.  Command line arguments are not currently supported.
 *
 *        For Dataplot return the character string as an integer
 *        array of ASCII decimal equivalents.  This is done for
 *        portability reasons (with some loss in efficiency).  Compilers
 *        are not consistent in how strings are passed when calling C
 *        from Fortran.

/*
 *  Note that calling C from Fortran is not standard.  I have
 *  provided the following compiler defintions to enhance portability.
 *
 *  1) The default is to assume that the Fortran compiler appends an
 *     underscore to the routine name.  Use -DNOUNDERSCORE if your
 *     compiler does not append the underscore.
 *  2) The default is to assume that the Fortran compiler converts
 *     routine names to lower case.  Use -DUPPERCASE if your
 *     Fortran compiler does not do this (e.g., the Cray).
 *  3) Character strings are the most troublesome issue for
 *     portability.  Passing character strings from Fortran to C
 *     is very compiler dependent.  I have addressed this issue
 *     by passing character strings as arrays of ASCII Decimal
 *     Equivalents (ADE's).  That is, the Fortran converts a
 *     character string to an array of the integer values where
 *     the integer is the ASCII collating sequence (i.e., A = 65,
 *     B = 66, etc.).  The end of the string is denoted by setting
 *     the value to 0.  This is easily accomplished on the Fortran
 *     side by using the ICHAR function.  The C code here then
 *     calls an internal routine to covnert the integer array to
 *     a C string.   Although a bit convoluted, this avoids a lot
 *     of messy portability issues.
 *
 *  Default is an underscore and lower case.  The compiler specified
 *  definitions -DNOUNDERSCORE and -DUPPERCASE can be specified to
 *  override these defaults.
 *

 *  A few comments:
 *
 *  1) Dataplot only uses readline for reading terminal input.
 *  2) Dataplot will use ">" for the prompt.  Currently, this is
 *     not settable by the user.
 *  3) The maximum line length that Dataplot can currently handle
 *     is 255 characters.
 *
 *  The arguments are:
 *
 *  istring    - an integer array that contains the ASCII Decimal
 *               Equivalents to the character string returned from
 *               readline.
 *  nchar      - an integer that specifies the number of characters
