2**2 (FULL) FACTORIAL DESIGN WITH 2 CENTER POINTS
NUMBER OF LEVELS FOR EACH FACTOR =  3
NUMBER OF FACTORS                =  2
NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS           =  6
NOTE--THIS IS A 2**2 FULL FACTORIAL DESIGN
      AUGMENTED BY 2 CENTER POINTS.
NOTE--THIS DESIGN ALLOWS--
         1) SIMPLE ESTIMATES OF PLANAR PARAMETERS
         2) A SIMPLE ESTIMATE OF X1X2 INTERACTION EFFECT
         3) A SIMPLE CHECK OF CURVATURE EFFECT
         4) AN ESTIMATE OF SIGMA (VIA REPLICATION)
REFERENCE--BOX, HUNTER & HUNTER,
           STATISTICS FOR EXPERIMENTERS, PAGE 519
NOTE--IF POSSIBLE, THIS (AS WITH ALL EXPERIMENT DESIGNS) SHOULD BE
      RUN IN RANDOM ORDER (SEE DATAPLOT'S RANDOM PERMUTATION FILES).
NOTE--IN THE DESIGN BELOW,
         "-1" REPRESENTS THE "LOW"    SETTING OF A FACTOR
         "+1" REPRESENTS THE "HIGH"   SETTING OF A FACTOR
         "0"  REPRESENTS A   "MIDDLE" SETTING OF A FACTOR
NOTE--B1, B2, AND B12 EFFECT ESTIMATES ARE ALL OF THE FORM
      AVERAGE OF THE "HIGH" - AVERAGE OF THE "LOW"
