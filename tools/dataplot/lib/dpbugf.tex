Please include what platform you are running
Dataplot on and the version (in Dataplot, you
can enter a VERSION command).

It is also helpful if you can narrow down the
bug as much as possible.  If you have a sample
macro that demonstrates the bug, this is most
useful.  If that macro requires any data files,
please send those as well.
