#  This file contains the font specifications for xdp.

#  The font specifications allow a system administrator or user to easily
#  change the fonts used by xdp to their tastes or limitations of the hardware.

#  This file can exist in several locations.  It is searched for in several
#  directories and the first occurance of the file is the one that will be
#  used.  This way a user can have a different set of fonts than the default
#  values.

#  The order of the directories where xdp looks for this file is:
#  (1) the current directory, (2) the user's home directory, (3) the system
#  directory for the xdp Tcl files.  The file can be names xdpfont or .xdpfont

#  The first field contains the name of the platform (window, unix) or
#  operating system (IRIX, AIX, HP-UX, SunOS, etc.).  The operating system
#  is usually only specified for unix platforms.  Font specifications based
#  on operating system must appear after those specified by platform.

#  The second field contains only the strings variable, fixed_small, or
#  fixed_large.  These refer to the 3 different types of fonts used in xdp.
#  The variable font is used for buttons and menus.  The fixed fonts are used
#  for forms, some menus, entries, and text output.

#  The third field contains the font in Tcl format.  Each font contains 
#  three fields.  The first is the font family.  If the family name
#  contains blanks, then it must be enclosed in braces.  The second field
#  contains the point size of the font.  A + or - can be in front of the point
#  size.  This tells xdp that if a font with that point size cannot be found, 
#  then either increment or decrement the point size to find one that matches.  
#  The third field contains the string bold or normal.  The entire font 
#  specification must be enclosed in braces.
