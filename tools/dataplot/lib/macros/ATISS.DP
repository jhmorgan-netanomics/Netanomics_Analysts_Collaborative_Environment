. This is Dataplot macro   ATISS.DP
. Purpose--Generate an Average Total Inspection (AOQ) curve for a
.          single sample plan.
.          The ATI is defined as:
.              n + (1-Pa)*(nn-n)/n versus p
.          where 
.            n      = sample size
.            nn     = lot size
.            p      = desired probabilities
.            pa     = bincdf(c,p,n)
.                     where c is the acceptance number for defectives
.
. Input --N        = sample size
.       --NN       = lot size
.       --C        = number of defectives
.       --PSTART   = start value for p
.       --PINC     = increment value for p
.       --PSTOP    = stop value for p
. Output--graph
