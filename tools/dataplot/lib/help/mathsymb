This is Dataplot file    C:\DATAPLOT\HELP\MATHSYMB.
 
Purpose: List the Math symbols available within Dataplot
 
Example of usage:
 
   TEXT SUMM() INTE() INFI()
   TEXT LC() E SUP() PI() I UNSP() = -1
 
Within Dataplot, this MATH SYMBOLS file may be
viewed by entering:
 
   LIST MATHSYMB.     (be sure to include the trailing .)
 
Math symbols can be generated within any TEXT, TITLE,
LABEL, or LEGEND command.  Note that the math symbols
will appear ONLY when one of the Hershey fonts have
been specified (via the FONTS command):
 
   SIMPLEX                (e.g., FONT SIMPLEX)
   DUPLEX
   TRIPLEX
   TRIPLEX ITALIC
   COMPLEX
   SIMPLEX SCRIPT
   COMPLEX SCRIPT
 
To indicate that a mathematics symbol should appear in
some text string, simply enter the abbreviated (never
more than 4 characters) name from the list below and
append an open and closed parenthesis after the name,
as in INTE(), SUMM(), and DOTP().  The () is a flag to
DATAPLOT that the previous character sub-string is not
to be printed literally but rather should be converted
and drawn as a special symbol.
 
The mathematics symbols are--
 
   partial derivative       PART()
   integral                 INTE()
   circular integral        CINT()
   summation                SUMM()
   product                  PROD()
   infinity                 INFI()
   + or -                   +-()
   - or +                   -+()
   times                    TIME()
   dot product              DOTP()
 
   vector product           DEL()
   division                 DIVI()
   less than                LT()
   greater than             GT()
   less than or equal to    LTEQ()
   greater than or equal to GTEQ()
   not equal                NOT=()
   approximately equal to   APPR()
   equivalence              EQUI()
   varies                   VARI()
 
   tilda                    TILD()
   carat                    CARA()
   prime                    PRIM()
   radical                  RADI()
   large radical            LRAD()
   larger radical           BRAD()
   subset                   SUBS()
   superset                 SUPE()
   un-subset                UNSB()
   un-superset              UNSP()
 
   union                    UNIO()
   intersection             INTR()
   is an element of         ELEM()
   there exists             THEX()
   therefore                THFO()
 
Example --Go to the middle of screen, and draw out summation,
          integration, and infinity symbols in simplex font--
 
             FONT SIMPLEX
             MOVE 50 50
             TEXT SUMM()INTE()INFI()
 
Example --Go to the middle of screen, and write out
             A union B
          (a set theory notation) in upper case triplex font--
 
             CASE UPPER
             FONT TRIPLEX
             MOVE 50 50
             TEXT AUNIO()B
 
 
Enter   --HELP CAPITALIZATION to list case (lower/upper) information.
          HELP SUBSCIPTS to list sub/super-script information.
          HELP GREEK SYMBOLS to list Greek characters.
          HELP MISC SYMBOLS to list miscellaneous symbols.
