1. Error Bomb at Launch
   I installed the dataplot code onto my
   Windows 95/NT as directed in the ftp file

       /PUB/DATAPLOT/PD/README.MSF

   at the ftp site

      scf.nist.gov

   and it bombed immediately at launch
   with the run-time error message:

      F6416: OPEN() file note found

   What should I do?
   To correct this problem,
   create (via the MS-DOS Window command MKDIR)
   the subdirectory

       C:\TURBOC\FRONTEND

   and then relaunch dataplot.

   <Alan--I would like to move printpos.exe
          from C:\TURBOC\FRONTEND
          to   C:\DATAPLOT
          What do you think? >

6. Dataplot Icon

7. Large Text & Graphics Windows for Super-VGA
   I have super-vga
    and I want the larger text and graphics windows
    how do I do that?
    In c:\dataplot\dp.bat,   make sure that the  -svga option
    is on the execution line as follows:
       C:\DATAPLOT\DATAPLOT.EXE -SVGA

8. Small Text & Graphics Windows for VGA
   I do not have super-vga,
   how should I get vga text and graphics windows?
   In c:\dataplot\dp.bat,  omit the -svga option
   so that the execution line therein will be thus become
      C:\DATAPLOT\DATAPLOT.EXE

9. Exiting out of Dataplot
   how do I get out of dataplot and back to windows-nt
   In the dataplot text window, enter any of the following:
      EXIT STOP HALT END BYE QUIT

10. Automatic Post-Graphics Cursor into Text Window
    After I generate a plot in dataplot,
    the cursor & focus is in the upper left corner
    of the graphics window and I cannot enter the next command
    until I click in the text window;
    how do I get the cursor & focus to automatically go
    to the text window after a plot is generated?
    Ans. Enter manually the command
            DEVICE 1 FOCUS TEXT
         which instructs the cursor / focus
         to automatically go to the text window
         after plots.
         This command need be manually entered only
         at the beginning of a dataplot run;
         or better yet, enter (via any editor)
         this command line into Dataplot's login file:
            C:DATAPLOT\DPLOGF.TEX
          so that it will automatically executed upon launch

11. Smaller Font in Text Window
    How do I get smaller characters in the
    Dataplot text window?

12. Graphics Window Resizing
    I notice that when I resize my graphics window,
    the plot does not expand or contract accordingly;
    what can I do?

13. Text Window Scrolling Problems
    I notice that the text window does not scroll in a predictable
    fashion--I sometimes do not see the bottom of the text output,
    and when I enter commands, I sometimes do not see what I
    am entering?  What can I do?

    <Alan--I think the scrolling is being dictated
           by the totla frame window height as opposed
           to the text window height.  I experimented a bit
           and I think a good choice for the text and graphics
           windows (for super vga) would be to make the
           text and graphics windows to split the screen
           50-50 left right (text on left half and graphics
           on right half) with the text window being full
           frame height top to bottom, and the graphics window
           being about 3/4 frame height bottom to top with
           the graphics window being positioned in the
           bottom 3/4 of the right half of the screen.
           What are your thoughts on this? >

14. Text & Graphics Window Names
    Alan--could you change the text window name from

             Graphic1 => Text

          and the name of the graphics window from

             Dataplot_graphicsw => Graphics

    Also, I have copied the executable
    from   DPMSFORT.EXE
    to     Dataplot.EXE
    where the upper/lower case mixture in D a t a p l o t
    was deliberate so that the Windows 95/NT title
    in the title bar will in fact be
       Dataplot
    as opposed to
       DATAPLOT
    or
       DPMSFORT

15. Print Graphics Window
    When I type in

       PP

    to print (to a postscript laser printer)
    the current graphics window contents
    I get the error message

       THE PRINT FILE CAPABILITY NOT SUPPORTED
       ON HOST IBM-
       CONTACT YOUR SITE INSTALLER

    What should I do?
