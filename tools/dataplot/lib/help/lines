This is Dataplot file    C:\DATAPLOT\HELP\LINES.
 
Purpose: List the line types available within Dataplot
 
Example of usage:
 
   LINES BLANK SOLID
 
Within Dataplot, this LINES file may be viewed by entering:
 
   LIST LINES.     (be sure to include the trailing .)
 
You may specify 8 different line types within Dataplot:
 
   no line         BLANK or NONE   or BL or NO
   solid           SOLID or SO
   dotted          DOT   or DOTTED or DO
   dashed          DASH  or DASHED or DA
   dashed type 1   DASH1 or DA1
   dashed type 2   DASH2 or DA2
   dashed type 3   DASH3 or DA3
   dashed type 4   DASH4 or DA4
 
The short designations (e.g., BL for BLANK, SO for
SOLID, DA3 for DASH3) allow for the specification of a
large number of line types on a single command line, as in
 
   LINES SO SO SO SO SO DO DO DO DO DO DA DA DA DA DA
 
DATAPLOT does all dash patterns in hardware, so dashed
lines may have a somewhat different appearance on
different devices.
