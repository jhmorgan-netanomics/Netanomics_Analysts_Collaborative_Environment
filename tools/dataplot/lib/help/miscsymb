This is Dataplot file    C:\DATAPLOT\HELP\MISCSYMB.
 
Purpose: List the Miscellaneous symbols available
         within Dataplot
 
Example of usage:
 
   TEXT LCBR() ABCDEF RCBR()
   TEXT Temperature = 120 DEGR() C
 
Within Dataplot, this MISCELLANEOUS SYMBOLS file may be
viewed by entering
 
   LIST MISCSYMB.     (be sure to include the trailing .)
 
Miscellaneous symbols can be generated within any TEXT,
TITLE, LABEL, or LEGEND command.  Note that the
Miscellaneous symbols will appear ONLY when one of the
Hershey fonts have been specified (via the FONTS
command):
 
   SIMPLEX                (e.g., FONT SIMPLEX)
   DUPLEX
   TRIPLEX
   TRIPLEX ITALIC
   COMPLEX
   SIMPLEX SCRIPT
   COMPLEX SCRIPT
 
To indicate that a Miscellaneous symbol should appear in
some text string, simply enter the abbreviated (never
more than 4 characters) name from the list below and
append an open and closed parenthesis after the name,
as in INTE(), SUMM(), and DOTP().  The () is a flag to
DATAPLOT that the previous character sub-string is not
to be printed literally but rather should be converted
and drawn as a special symbol.
