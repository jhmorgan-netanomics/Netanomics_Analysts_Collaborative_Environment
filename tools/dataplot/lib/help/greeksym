This is Dataplot file    C:\DATAPLOT\HELP\GREEKSYMB.
 
Purpose: List the Greek symbols available within Dataplot
 
Example of usage:
 
   TEXT LC() ALPH() BETA() GAMMA()
   TEXT ALPH() BETA() GAMM()
 
Within Dataplot, this GREEK SYMBOLS file may be
viewed by entering:
 
   LIST GREEKSYMB.     (be sure to include the trailing .)
 
Greek symbols can be generated within any TEXT, TITLE,
LABEL, or LEGEND command whenever the Hershey fonts
(simplex, duplex, triplex, triplex Note that the Greek
symbols will appear ONLY when the Hershey fonts :
 
   SIMPLEX
   DUPLEX
   TRIPLEX
   TRIPLEX ITALIC
   COMPLEX
   SIMPLEX SCRIPT
   COMPLEX SCRIPT
 
have been specified (via the FONT command).
Both lower and upper case Greek symbols are available (see
the CASE command).
 
To indicate that a Greek symbol should appear in some
text string, simply enter the English name of the
desired Greek letter and append an open and closed
parenthesis after the name, as in PI(), RHO(), and
TAU().  The () is a flag to DATAPLOT that the previous
character sub-string is not to be printed literally but
rather should be converted and drawn as a special
symbol.  Greek names longer than 4 letters should be
truncated to 4 letters, as in ALPH(), GAMM(), and
OMEG().
 
The Greek symbols are--
 
   alpha          ALPH()
   beta           BETA()
   gamma          GAMM()
   delta          DELT()
   epsilon        EPSI()
   zeta           ZETA()
   eta            ETA()
   theta          THET()
   iota           IOTA()
   kappa          KAPP()
   lambda         LAMB()
   mu             MU()
   nu             NU()
   xi             XI()
   omicon         OMIC()
   pi             PI()
   rho            RHO()
   sigma          SIGM()
   tau            TAU()
   upsilon        UPSI()
   phi            PHI()
   chi            CHI()
   psi            PSI()
   omega          OMEG()
 
Example --Go to the middle of screen, and write out the
          first 3 Greek letters in lower case simplex
          font--
 
             CASE LOWER
             FONT SIMPLEX

          font--
 
             CASE LOWER
             FONT TRIPLEX
             MOVE 50 50
             TEXT THE VALUE OF PI() = 3.1415926
