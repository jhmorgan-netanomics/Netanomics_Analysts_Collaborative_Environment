OVERVIEW
DATAPLOT is a language for
 
   1) graphics (continuous or discrete);
   2) fitting (non-linear or linear);
   3) general data analysis;
   4) mathematics.
 
DATAPLOT commands are high-level, English-syntax, and
self-descriptive, such as
 
   PLOT Y X
   PLOT EXP(-X**2) FOR X = -3 .1 3
   FIT Y = A+B*EXP(-ALPHA*X)
   BOX PLOT Y X
   ANOVA Y X1 X2 X3
   LET A = ROOTS SIN(X**2)+EXP(-X) FOR X = 0 TO 5
 
The 3 most important commands are PLOT, FIT, and LET.
The "average" analyst commonly uses about 20 commands.
The language as a whole consists of over 200 commands.
These 200+ commands are in 7 command categories.  For a
list of commands within each command category, enter
HELP followed by the category name--

Output Device Commands
 
DATAPLOT supports the following built-in device drivers:
 
    Tektronix     - most models (4010, 4014, 4105, 4113, 4115, 4027,
                    4662/4663), other Tektronix terminals typically
                    emulate one of these models
    REGIS         - for DEC terminals (VT-240, VT-340)
    HP-GL         - Hewlett-Packard plotters (can specify various
                    models including LaserJet III), emulated by many
                    plotter vendors
    HP 2622       - Hewlett-Packard terminal, also includes related
                    models (2623, 2647, and others)
    POSTSCRIPT    - used by many laser printers and other hard copy
                    devices
    QUIC          - used by QMS (and some Talaris) laser printers
    HP 7221       - Hewlett-Packard 7221 plotter
    GENERAL       - DATAPLOT specific metafile
    CGM           - ANSI standard Computer Graphics Metafile.
                    Currently only the clear text encoding is
                    supported.
 
Many devices provide either Tektronix, HP-GL, or Postscript emulation.
 
In addition, the following devices are available, but require some
local installation (usually linking the proper device library).
Contact your local site installer to find out if the desired device is
available.
 
    X11           - MIT windowing system, supported on most Unix based
                    workstations.  Has been tested on Sun, SGI,
                    HP-9000, VAX/ULTRIX, IBM RS-6000, Convex, and Cray.
                    Use this driver if you are running either Open Look
                    or Motif window systems.
    Sun CGI       - available on Sun only.  Uses the CGI library and
                    runs in a gfxtool or SunView window.  Sun is
                    phasing out support of CGI and going to an Open
                    Look based window system, so the X11 driver is
                    recommended even for the Sun.
    Calcomp       - uses the standard Calcomp library.  Many penplotter
                    vendors provide a Calcomp compatible library for
                    using their plotters.
    Zeta          - Zeta plotters.  Uses a slightly modified version of
                    the Calcomp library.
    IBM PC        - available for PC only.  This driver is still under
                    development, so may not be available in the public
                    PC version.  If you are simply using the PC as a
                    terminal, find a communications package that
                    provides either Tektronix or REGIS emulation.
 
DATAPLOT supports 3 devices (defined by DEVICE 1, DEVICE 2, and
DEVICE 3).  Device 1 output is sent to the screen and device 2 output
is sent to a file (DPPL1F.DAT or dppl1f.dat on most systems).  Device 3
output is also sent to a file (DPPL2F.DAT or dppl2f.dat on most
systems), but it only contains the most recent plot.  DATAPLOT supports
all 3 devices simultaneously if desired (that is, a single PLOT command
can generate both the plot on the screen and also write the plot to a
file for later printing).  The default is for device 1 to be a
Tektronix 4014 terminal, device 2 to be off, and device 3 to be a
Postscript printer.

FUNCTIONS
Functions
 
DATAPLOT has an extensive library of built-in functions; these
functions find valuable application in the LET, LET FUNCTION, FIT,
PRE-FIT, PLOT, and 3D-PLOT commands.
 
The available functions fall into 3 general categories--
 
   1) General mathematical functions;
      For a list of such functions, enter HELP MATHEMATICS FUNCTIONS
      or HELP MATH FUNCTIONS   .
 
   2) Trigonometric functions;
      For a list of such functions, enter HELP TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
      or HELP TRIG FUNCTIONS   .
 
   3) Probability functions;
      For a list of such functions, enter HELP PROBABILITY FUNCTIONS
      or HELP PROB FUNCTIONS   .
 
Library functions are distinguished from LET subcommands in the
following ways--
 
   1) Functions enclose the input value in parenthesis.  LET
      subcommands use spaces.
 
   2) Functions can accept (and return) either parameters (i.e., single
      values) or variables (i.e., an array of values) while LET
      subcommands are specific in which they accept as input and what
      they return as output.
 
   3) Functions can accept expressions while LET subcommands do not.
      For example, the following is legal:
 
         LET Y2 = ABS(Y1-INT(Y2))
 
      For LET subcommands, you typically have to do something like the
      following:
 
         LET YTEMP = Y**2 + 8
         LET A = SUM YTEMP

-------------------------  *LET SUBCOMMANDS*  ------------
 
LET SUBCOMMANDS
LET Subcommands
 
The LET command is the single most powerful command in DATAPLOT. The
most important capability of the LET command is carrying out function
evaluations and variable transformations.  Such evaluations and
transformations are general--any Fortran-like expression can be used.
 
In addition, the LET command can also be used by the analyst to carry
out a broad spectrum of statistical,  mathematical,  and  probabilistic
operations.  These operations are specified by inclusion of subcommands
under the LET command.  These subcommands fall into 4 general
categories--
 
   1. Computing Statistics
      For a list of available statistics, enter HELP STATISTICS
 
   2. Performing Mathematical Operations
      For a list of available operations, enter HELP MATH OPERATIONS
 
   3. Performing Matrix Operations
      For a list of available operations, enter HELP MATRIX OPERATIONS
 
   4. Generating Random Numbers
      For a list of available distributions, enter HELP RANDOM NUMBERS
 
LET subcommands are distinguished from library functions in the
following ways--
 
   1) Functions enclose the input value in parenthesis.  LET
      subcommands use spaces.
 
   2) Functions can accept (and return) either parameters (i.e., single
      values) or variables (i.e., an array of values) while LET
      subcommands are specific in which they accept as input and what
      they return as output.
 
   3) Functions can accept expressions while LET subcommands do not.
      For example, the following is legal:
 
         LET Y2 = ABS(Y1-INT(Y2))
 
      For LET subcommands, you typically have to do something like the
      following:
 
         LET YTEMP = Y**2 + 8
         LET A = SUM YTEMP

-------------------------  *STATISTICS*  -----------------
 
STATISTICS
Statistics
 
The calculation of individual statistics is done via subcommands under
the LET command, as in
 
   LET A = MEAN X
   LET B = STANDARD DEVIATION Y
   LET C = CORRELATION X Y
 
Statistics are computed on either one, two, or three response variables
(never parameters or functions) and the computed statistic is always
stored in a parameter (never a variable or function).

Supported statistics can be used in the following commands:

   1. LET A = <stat>
   2. <stat> STATISTIC PLOT
   3. <stat> CUMULATIVE STATISTIC PLOT
   4. <stat> MOVING STATISTIC PLOT
   5. <stat> WINDOW STATISTIC PLOT
   6. CROSS TABULATE <stat> STATISTIC PLOT
   7. FLUCTUATION PLOT <stat>
   8. TABULATION PLOT <stat>
   9. <STAT> BLOCK PLOT
  10. BOOTSTRAP <STAT> PLOT
  11. JACKNIFE <STAT> PLOT
  12. DEX <STAT> PLOT
  13. DEX <STAT> EFFECTS PLOT
  14. DEX <STAT> ABSOLUTE EFFECTS PLOT
  15. DEX <STAT> PARETO PLOT
  16. DEX <STAT> PARETO EFFECTS PLOT
  17. DEX <STAT> PARETO ABSOLUTE EFFECTS PLOT
  18. DEX <STAT> YOUDEN PLOT
  19. CLASSIFICATION <STAT> CURVE
  20. <STAT> INFLUENCE CURVE
  21. CROSS TABULATE <STAT>
  22. POSITIONAL TABULATION <STAT>
  23. TWO SAMPLE <STAT> PERMUTATION TEST
  24. LET V = MATRIX COLUMN <STAT>
  25. LET V = MATRIX ROW <STAT>
  26. LET A = MATRIX GRAND <STAT>
  27. LET M = MATRIX PARTITION <STAT>
  28. LET M = GENERATE MATRIX <STAT>
  29. LET V = CROSS TABULATE <STAT>
  30. LET V = CROSS TABULATE CUMULATIVE <STAT>
  31. LET V = SORT BY <STAT>
  32. LET YOUT = MOVING <STAT>
  33. LET YOUT = CUMULATIVE <STAT>
  34. <STAT> INTERACTION PLOT <STAT>

Some of the above commands only support the case where the
statistic is computed from a single response variable.

The available statistical subcommands are (for the specifics of a
given statistic, enter HELP <stat> where <stat> denotes one of the
statistics given here)--

specified (via the LET command) before generating the random numbers.
 
The SEED command is used to specify the seed for the random number
generator.
 
The available random number generators are--

DISTRIBUTIONS REQUIRING THE PARAMETERS A AND C
   WARING RANDOM NUMBER            Generate Waring random numbers

Several distributions generate a matrix, as oppossed to a vector,
of random numbers.

Multivariate normal distribution:

   LET MU = DATA <list of p means>
   READ MATRIX SIGMA
      <pxp set of values>
   END OF DATA
   LET N = <value>
   LET M = MULTIVARIATE NORMAL RANDOM NUMBERS MU SIGMA N

   Note that M will be an NxP matrix.  N is the number of rows
   generated for each component and their are P components to
   the multivariate normal.  SIGMA is the pxp variance-covariance
   matrix of the multivariate normal.  SIGMA will be checked to
   ensure that it is a positive definite matrix.  MU is a vector
   specifying the means of the p components.

Multivariate t distribution:

   LET MU = DATA <list of p means>
   LET NU = DATA <list of p degrees of freedom>
   READ MATRIX SIGMA
      <pxp set of values>
   END OF DATA
   LET N = <value>
   LET M = MULTIVARIATE T RANDOM NUMBERS MU SIGMA NU N

   The variables are the same as for the multivariate normal random
   numbers with the exception that there is an additional vector,
   NU, that specifies the degrees of freedom for the p components.

Uniform distribution:

   LET U = INDEPENDENT UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERSS LOWL UPPL NP
   LET U = MULTIVARIATE UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERSS SIGMA N

   The first syntax generates independent uniform random numbers
   with LOWL and UPPL denoting vectors that contain the lower and
   upper limits for the uniform distributions, respectively.  The
   scalar NP denotes the number of rows to generate.

   The second syntax generates correlated uniform random numbers.
   The matrix SIGMA is the variance-covariance matrix of a
   multivariate normal distribution and N denotes the number of
   rows to generate.

Multinomial distribution:

   LET P = DATA <list of probabilities that sum to 1>
   LET N = <value>
   LET NEVENTS = <value>
   LET M = MULTINOMIAL RANDOM NUMBERS P N NEVENTS

   The P variable defines the probabilities for each of the
   outcomes, N defines the number of trials, and NEVENTS
   defines the number of multinomial experiments to simulate.
   The returned M will be a matrix with NEVENTS rows and
   the number of columns equal to the number of rows in P.

Dirichlet distribution:

   LET ALPHA = DATA <list of shape parameters>
   LET N = <value>
   LET D = DIRICHLET RANDOM NUMBERS ALPHA N

   The ALPHA variable contains the shape parameters of the
   Dirichlet distribution and N denotes the number of rows to
   generate.

Wishart distribution:

   LET P = DATA <list of probabilities that sum to 1>
   LET N = <value>
   LET NEVENTS = <value>
   LET W = WISHART RANDOM NUMBERS MU SIGMA N

   Note that W will be a PxP matrix.  N is a scalar that specifies
   the sample size.  SIGMA is the pxp variance-covariance
   matrix of the multivariate normal.  SIGMA will be checked to
   ensure that it is a positive definite matrix.  MU is a vector
   specifying the means of the p components.


Also, as of the May, 2002 version, support is provided for several
different uniform random number generators.  Enter
HELP RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR for details.

-------------------------  *TEXT SUBCOMMANDS*-------------
 
TEXT SUBCOMMANDS
Text Subcommands
 
An important feature of the TEXT, TITLE, LABEL, and LEGEND commands is
the ability to use within-text subcommands to specify the following--
 
   1) To temporarily change the case (upper versus lower) in mid-text.
      For example, leading characters of words can be upper case and
      trailing characters can be lower case.
 
   2) To shift to subscripts and superscripts in mid-text.
 
   3) To generate Greek letters.
 
   4) To generate mathematical symbols (for example, integral sign,
      partial derivative sign, etc.).
 
   5) To generate other special symbols (for example, brackets,
      arrows, carats, daggers, etc.).
 
The above may be done whenever the Hershey fonts (simplex, duplex,
triplex, triplex italic, complex, simplex script, and complex script)
have been specified (see the FONT command).  The only special symbols
recognized with hardware fonts are the in-line case shifts (i.e., upper
and lower case) and the space character.
 
Within-text subcommands (indicators) are used to specify the desired
text operations.  For example--
 
   UC()   to shift to capital letters;
   SUB()  to shift to subscript mode;
   ALPH() to draw a Greek alpha;
   INTE() to draw an integral;
   RBRA() to draw a right bracket.
 
The within-text subcommands are all distinguished by an appended ().
The () is a flag to DATAPLOT that the previous character sub-string is
not to be printed literally but rather should be converted and acted
upon in a special fashion.
 
Enter   --HELP CAPITALIZATION to list case (lower/upper) information.
          HELP SUBSCIPTS to list sub/super-script information.
          HELP GREEK SYMBOLS to list Greek characters.
          HELP MATH SYMBOLS to list mathematics symbols.
          HELP MISC SYMBOLS to list miscellaneous symbols.

-------------------------  *CAPITALIZATION*  -------------
 
CAPITALIZATION
Capitalization
 
DATAPLOT by default prints all text in upper case.  Simply entering
the text in lower case is not sufficient to have it printed in lower
case.
 
Shifts between capitalized letters and non-capitalized letters can be
carried out within text strings generated by any TEXT, TITLE, LABEL, or
LEGEND command.  Case shifts are recognized for both hardware and
software generated text.
 
To shift to upper case, enter CAPS(), CAP(), or UC() followed by the
desired text sub-string.  To shift to lower case, enter LC() followed
by the desired text sub-string.
 
The within-text case shifting overrides the setting from the CASE
command.  If the within-text case shift takes place mid-line, then the
first part of the text string follows whatever the current setting is
as given by the CASE command.  At the end of a text line with a case
shift, the current CASE command setting takes effect again.
 
The capitalization indicators are--
 
   upper case        UC(), CAP(), CAPS()
   lower case        LC()
 
If all characters on a text line are to have the same case, either all
upper or all lower, then it is easier to set the case globally with the
CASE command than using within-text case shifts.  For example,
 
   CASE UPPER
   CASE LOWER
 
Example --Go to the middle of screen, and write out "DATAPLOT is from
          NBS" with all symbols in simplex font--
             CASE UPPER
             FONT SIMPLEX
             MOVE 50 50
             TEXT DATAPLOT LC()IS FROM UC()NBS
Example --Go to the middle of screen, and write out "Future Goals"
          in triplex font--
             FONT TRIPLEX
             MOVE 50 50
             TEXT UC()FLC()UTURE UC()GLC()OALS
 
Enter   --HELP CASE to list information about the CASE command.
          HELP SUBSCIPTS to list sub/super-script information.
          HELP GREEK SYMBOLS to list Greek characters.
          HELP MATH SYMBOLS to list mathematics symbols.
          HELP MISC SYMBOLS to list miscellaneous symbols.
 
Note    --Upper and lower case characters can now be entered without
          using UC() and LC() shifts.  The various CASE commands
          (CASE, LABEL CASE, TITLE CASE, LEGEND CASE) accept an ASIS
          clause in addition to UPPER and LOWER.  The ASIS clause
          specifies that the case will be preserved as entered on the
          command line.  For example,
              CASE ASIS
              TEXT Mix UPPER and lower case Characters

-------------------------  *SUBSCRIPTS*  -----------------
 
SUBSCRIPTS
Subscripts
 
Subscripts and superscripts can be generated within any TEXT, TITLE,
LABEL, or LEGEND command whenever the Hershey fonts (simplex, duplex,
triplex, triplex italic, complex, simplex script, and complex script)
have been specified (see the FONT command).
 
To shift to subscript mode, simply enter SUB() followed by the desired
subscript.  To terminate subscript mode, enter UNSB() and continue on
with the desired text.  Similarly, SUP() shifts into superscript mode,
and UNSP() shifts out of superscipt mode.  The () is a flag to DATAPLOT
that the previous character sub-string is not to be printed literally
but rather should be converted and acted upon in a special fashion.  It
is an indicator that is used not only for sub/super-scripting, but also
for Greek symbols, mathematics symbols, and other special symbols.
 
Subscript and superscript strings can be of any length.  Nested
subscripts and superscripts are permitted 7 deep.  The size of a
sub/super-script is always half the size of the previous level.
 
The sub/super-script indicators are--
 
   subscript           SUB()
   un-subscript        UNSB()
   superscript         SUP()
   un-superscript      UNSP()
 
Example --Go to the middle of screen, and write out
             e = mc squared      (Einstein's classic equation)
          with all symbols in lower case simplex font--
             CASE LOWER
             FONT SIMPLEX
             MOVE 50 50
             TEXT E = MCSUP()2
Example --Go to the middle of screen, and write out
             T (with superscript *) = e (with superscript integral f)
          in lower case triplex font--
             CASE LOWER
             FONT TRIPLEX
             MOVE 50 50
             TEXT TSUP()*UNSP() = ESUP()INTE()F
 
Enter   --HELP CAPITALIZATION to list case (lower/upper) information.
          HELP GREEK SYMBOLS to list Greek characters.
          HELP MATH SYMBOLS to list mathematics symbols.
          HELP MISC SYMBOLS to list miscellaneous symbols.

-------------------------  *GREEK SYMBOLS*  --------------
 
GREEK SYMBOLS
Greek Symbols
 
Greek symbols can be generated within any TEXT, TITLE, LABEL, or LEGEND
command whenever the Hershey fonts (simplex, duplex, triplex, triplex
italic, complex, simplex script, and complex script) have been
specified (see the FONT command).  Both lower case and upper case Greek
symbols are available (see the CASE command).
 
To indicate that a Greek symbol should appear in some text string,
simply enter the English name of the desired Greek letter and append an
open and closed parenthesis after the name, as in PI(), RHO(), and
TAU().  The () is a flag to DATAPLOT that the previous character
sub-string is not to be printed literally but rather should be
converted and drawn as a special symbol.  Greek names longer than 4
letters should be truncated to 4 letters, as in ALPH(), GAMM(), and
OMEG().
 
The Greek symbols are--
 
   alpha          ALPH()
   beta           BETA()
   gamma          GAMM()
   delta          DELT()
   epsilon        EPSI()
   zeta           ZETA()
   eta            ETA()

   chi            CHI()
   psi            PSI()
   omega          OMEG()
 
Example --Go to the middle of screen, and write out the first 3 Greek
          letters in lower case simplex font--
             CASE LOWER

MATHEMATICS SYMBOLS
Mathematics Symbols
 
Mathematics symbols can be generated within any TEXT, TITLE, LABEL, or
LEGEND command whenever the Hershey fonts (simplex, duplex, triplex,
triplex italic, complex, simplex script, and complex script) have been
specified (see the FONT command).
 
To indicate that a mathematics symbol should appear in some text
string, simply enter the abbreviated (never more than 4 characters)
name from the list below and append an open and closed parenthesis
after the name, as in INTE(), SUMM(), and DOTP().  The () is a flag to
DATAPLOT that the previous character sub-string is not to be printed
literally but rather should be converted and drawn as a special symbol.
 
The mathematics symbols are--
 
   partial derivative       PART()
   integral                 INTE()
   circular integral        CINT()
   summation                SUMM()

MISCELLANEOUS SYMBOLS
Miscellaneous Symbols
 
Miscellaneous symbols can be generated within any TEXT, TITLE, LABEL,
or LEGEND command whenever the Hershey fonts (simplex, duplex, triplex,
triplex italic, complex, simplex script, and complex script) have been
specified (see the FONT command).
 
To indicate that a special symbol should appear in some text string,
simply enter the abbreviated (never more than 4 characters) name from
the list below and append an open and closed parenthesis after the
name, as in LAPO(), LBRA(), and RBRA().  The () is a flag to DATAPLOT
that the previous character sub-string is not to be printed literally
but rather should be converted and drawn as a special symbol.
 
The miscellaneous symbols are--
 
   space                    SP()
   carriage return          CR()
   left apostrophe          LAPO()

   bar                      BAR()
   degree                   DEGR()
 
The SP() and CR() can be used with hardware fonts.  The SP()
is useful as a placeholder (e.g., for alphabetic tic mark labels,
it can be used for an empty group).  The CR() can be used for
multiline text.  For example, you can create a multiline title.

EXAMPLE --Go to the middle of screen, and draw out ABC surrounded by
          curly brackets with ABC in upper case simplex font--
             CASE UPPER

-------------------------  *LINE TYPES*  -----------------
 
LINE TYPES
Line Types
 
The available line types are--
 
   no line         BLANK or NONE or BL or NO
   solid           SOLID or SO
   dotted          DOT or DOTTED or DO
   dashed          DASH or DASHED or DA
   dashed type 1   DASH1 or DA1
   dashed type 2   DASH2 or DA2
   dashed type 3   DASH3 or DA3
   dashed type 4   DASH4 or DA4
 
The short designations (e.g., BL for BLANK, SO for SOLID, DA3 for
DASH3) allow for the specification of a large number of line types on a
single command line, as in
 
   LINES SO SO SO SO SO DO DO DO DO DO DA DA DA DA DA
 
DATAPLOT does all dash patterns in hardware, so dashed lines may have a
somewhat different appearance on different devices.

-------------------------  *COLOR TYPES*  ----------------
 
COLOR TYPES
Color Types
 
The graphics devices that DATAPLOT supports vary widely in the degree
to which they support color.  However, for the sake of device
independence, all devices will recognize the same set of color names
and color indices.  If a given device does not support a requested
color, DATAPLOT maps it to the closest available supported color
(closest is somewhat arbitrary, although we tried to be reasonably
consistent).
 
DATAPLOT adopted its color scheme from Release 3 of X11 with a few
additions from Release 4.  It also uses the RGB values from Release 4
for those devices that support direct RGB specification.  Although these
values should be reasonably robust, different devices will generate
different colors from them.

NOTE 2020/11: Dataplot added additional colors from the current X11
              versions.  Specifically, colors 89 to 162 in the list
              below were added in the 2020/11 version.
 
NOTE 2020/11: Dataplot added support for specifying colors as RGB
              triplets.  This is implemented via RGB COLOR commands.
              For example, there is now a LINE RGB COLOR command in
              addition to the LINE COLOR command.

              Dataplot still supports a number of devices that do not
              provide full RGB color support.  To handle this, Dataplot
              first checks if the device has full RGB color support.
              If so, Dataplot uses the settings from the RGB COLOR
              command (if given).  If the device does not support full
              RGB colors or if no RGB COLOR command was issued, then
              the setting from the COLOR command is used.

              Dataplot does not provide any built-in templates for RGB
              color schemes.  However, the following website provides
              165 different RGB color schemes developed by Cynthia Brewer
              (you can download an Excel file that contains the schemes).

                   http://colorbrewer.org/

              Numerous other RGB color templates are available.

The following is the list of colors that DATAPLOT recognizes.  Only the
first 4 characters of the color name are significant and colors can
also be specified by an index.

In addition, gray scale can be specified with the following scheme:
 
        G0     = BLACK
        G1-G99 = GRAY SCALE FROM BLACK TO WHITE
        G100   = WHITE
 
Gray scale values can also be specified with negative indices (that is,
-1 through -100).
 
Devices that do not support gray scale will map gray scale colors
to either black or white.  These are primarily older essentially
obsolete devices.

Penplotters no longer automatically map an index to the corresponding
slot.  DATAPLOT assumes the following slot to color mapping:
 
        4 PENS            8 PENS:
        ======            =======
        BLACK             BLACK
        RED               RED
        BLUE              BLUE
        GREEN             GREEN
                          MAGENTA
                          ORANGE
                          CYAN
                          YELLOW
 
You can use the <HPGL/CALCOMP/ZETA> PEN MAP command to specify a
different slot to color mapping for HP-GL, Calcomp, and Zeta plotters
respectively.
 
The following command shows the available colors.
 
         SHOW COLORS
 
The following commands show the colors available on the various color
devices that DATAPLOT supports.  That is, they show the color you
actually get with the requested DATAPLOT color for that device.
 
         SHOW COLORS TEKT 4115
         SHOW COLORS TEKT 4662
         SHOW COLORS TEKT 4027
         SHOW COLORS HP 2622
         SHOW COLORS CALCOMP
         SHOW COLORS ZETA
         SHOW COLORS CGM
         SHOW COLORS GENERAL
         SHOW COLORS SUN
         SHOW COLORS REGIS
         SHOW COLORS POSTSCRIPT
         SHOW COLORS X11
         SHOW COLORS PC
 
For some color display terminals (e.g., Tektronix 4105/7/9/15), the
color can be altered locally after the plot has been generated on the
screen.  This gives the analyst a "second chance" if the original
color choices do not mix well.
 
Finally, be wary of the idiosyncracies of color hardcopy devices.  They
rarely capture the same color hues as on the screen (e.g., the
Tektronix 4662 ink jet plotter maps a brilliant blue on the 4105/7/9/15
screen into a drab purple on the hardcopy).  Also note that it is
common for color hardcopies to map screen white into hardcopy black
and vice versa.

Note that the Postscript device is set to black and white by
default.  To activate color for Postscript devices, do the
following:

     DEVICE 2 POSTSCRIPT
     DEVICE 2 COLOR ON

Note that the order of these commands is relevant.

-------------------------  *ASCII FILES*  ----------------
 
ASCII FILES
Ascii Files
 
This section provides guidance on reading ASCII data files in
Dataplot.  This includes discussion of some commands added to
the 1/2004 version of Dataplot.  In particular, discussion is
included for ASCII files created by the Excel program.

Dataplot has limited support for binary data files.  Currently,
only binary files created using Fortran unformatted WRITE are
supported.  Enter HELP SET READ FORMAT for details.

Also, Dataplot does not currently support directly reading files
from other statistical/spreadsheet programs or database files.
Some support may be provided in future releases, but for now
you need to save the data from these programs in an ASCII file
in order to read them into Dataplot.  XML based data files are
becoming increasingly popular as well.  At this time, Dataplot does
not support XML based data files, although we anticipate looking
at this issue for subsequent releases.


IDEAL CASE

By default, Dataplot assumes rectangular data files containing
numeric data where the data columns are separated by one or
more spaces.  Commas or tabs may be used as delimiters as well.  

In this case, you can read the file with a command like the
following:

    READ  FILE.DAT  Y X1 X2

The first argument after the READ is the name of the ASCII file.
The remaining arguments identify the variable names.  Variable
names can be up to eight characters long and should be limited
to alphabetic (A-Z) and numeric (0-9) characters.  Although
other characters can in fact be used, this is discouraged
since their use can cause problems in some contexts.  Variable
names are not case sensitive (Dataplot converts all alphabetic
characters to upper case).

Dataplot recognizes the first argument as a file name if it
finds a "." in the name.  If no "." is found, Dataplot assumes
the first argument is a variable name and it tries to read
from the keyboard rather than the file.

The remainder of this section discusses various issues that
may cause problems when reading ASCII files and provides
suggestions on how to deal with  these issues.  The following
topics are discussed:

   1. Viewing ASCII files within Dataplot
   2. Header lines/restricted rows or columns
   3. Long data records
   4. Automatic variable names
   5. Reading fixed columns
   6. Reading variables with unequal lengths (empty fields)
   7. Reading character data
   8. Reading row oriented data
   9. Comment lines in data files
  10. Reading Excel files
  11. File name restrictions
  12. Comma as decimal point
  13. Missing values and undefined numbers
  14. Reading date and time fields
  15. Reading IP addresses
  16. Reading monetary data (e.g., $23,461,58)
  17. Reading numeric values with trailing "+" or "-"
  18. Commas withing character fields
  19. Reading binary data
  20. Reading image data
  21. What if all of the data will not fit into memory?

If you create the ASCII file yourself, it is recommended that
you create it with variables of equal length (pick some numeric
value to signify missing data) and with data items separated by one
or more spaces.  Inclusion of a header giving a description of
the data file is optional, but we find it helpful (Dataplot
can skip over the header lines).  When the ASCII files are created
by another program (e.g., Excel), then you may have less control
over the format of the file.  Hopefully, most ASCII files you
encounter can be handled using the commands discussed below.


VIEWING THE ASCII FILE WITHIN DATAPLOT

In order to identify some of the issues discussed below, it is
often helpful to view the ASCII file before trying to read it into
Dataplot.  You can do this with the command

    LIST FILE.DAT

This will list the file 20 lines (you can change the number
of lines with the SET LIST LINES command) at a time.  You
can then enter a carriage return to view the next 20 lines or
a "no" to stop viewing the file.

For some of the commands given below, you need to either know
approriate line numbers or column numbers.

To view the file with line numbers, enter the command

   NLIST  FILE.DAT

To identify appropriate columns, enter the command

   RULER

This will identify the first 80 columns.


HEADER LINES/RESTRICTED ROWS OR COLUMNS

Many data files contain header lines at the beginning of the
file that provide a description of the file.  In order to
skip over these lines, enter the command

    SKIP N

where N identifies how many lines to skip.

Most of the sample data files that are distributed with Dataplot
contain a line starting with hyphens ("---").  You can use the
command 

    SKIP AUTOMATIC

for these files.  Dataplot will skip all lines until a line
starting with three or more hypens is encoutered.
 
In a related issue, if you want to restrict the read to certain
rows in the file, you can enter the command

    ROW LIMITS  N1  N2

with N1 and N2 denoting the first and last rows to read,
respectively. 

You can also restrict the read to certain columns of the file
using the command

    COLUMN LIMITS  C1  C2

with C1 denoting the first column to read and C2 the last column
to read.


LONG DATA RECORDS

When reading from the keyboard, Dataplot restricts a single record
to a maximum of 80 columns.

When reading from a file, Dataplot previously restricted a single
record to a maximum of 132 columns.  The March, 2003 version raised
the default limit to 255 characters.  In addition, the following
command was added:

   SET MAXIMUM RECORD LENGTH  N

with N denoting the size of the largest record to be read.

Dataplot accepts values of N up to 9999.  However, be aware
that some Fortran compilers may impose their own limit.  These
limits tend not to be well documented, but with modern compilers
they tend to be sufficiently large that this should not be a
problem in practice.

If you specify a SET READ FORMAT command (discussed below), you
do not need to specify the maximum record length.


AUTOMATIC VARIABLE NAMES

Dataplot normally reads variable names on the READ command.
However, many ASCII files will have the name of the variables
given directly in the file or Dataplot can assign the variable
names automatically.

Specific methods include the following.

  1. Many of the sample files provided in the Dataplot 
     installation use a syntax like

         Y     X1   X2
        ----------------
           <data values>

     For these files, you can enter the commands

         SKIP AUTOMATIC
         READ FILE.DAT

     In this case, Dataplot will skip all lines until a line
     starting with three or more hypens is encountered.  It
     will then backspace to the previous line and read the
     variable names from that line.

  2. Many ASCII data files will have the variable names on
     the first line of the file.  For these files, you can
     enter the commands

        SET READ VARIABLE LABELS ON
        READ FILE.DAT

  3. If you would like Dataplot to simply assign the variable
     names, enter the command

         READ FILE.DAT

     Dataplot will read the first line of the file to determine
     the number of variables.  It will then assign the names
     X1, X2, and so on to the variable names.

Note that Dataplot's usual rules for variable names still apply.
That is, a maximum of eight characters will be used and spaces will
delimit variable names.  The use of special (i.e., not a number and
not an alphabetic character) characters is discouraged.  You may
need to edit the file if the variable names do not follow these
rules (more than eight characters will simply be ignored, so the
issue is more one of duplicate variable names in the first eight
characters).

Note 2020/08: The following tweaks were made to the reading of
variable names.

  1. Previously, only the first 255 characters of the line were read.
     This has been extended to support the number of characters
     specified by the MAXIMUM RECORD LENGTH command (if this command is
     not given, the default remains 255).

  2) Dataplot will now automatically strip spaces and other special
     characters out of the variable names.  Specifically, only alphabetic
     characters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores are retained.

  3) Dataplot only supports eight characters for variable names.  This
     can lead to duplicate file names.  To reduce the possibility of
     duplicate names, Dataplot does the following if a duplicate name
     is found.

     a) If the name has less than eight characters, a "Z" is appended
        to the end of one of the names.  The right most name will
        be modified.

     b) If the name has eight characters exactly, the right most name
        will change the last character to a Z (or if that character is
        already a Z, then to a X).

     c) If blank names are encountered, these will be changed to
        Zxxx where "xxx" is a sequence number (i.e., if there are three
        blank names encountered, they wiil be set to Z1, Z2, and Z3).

READING FIXED COLUMNS

By default, Dataplot performs free format reads.  That is,
you do not need to line up the columns neatly.  You do need
to provide one or more spaces (tabs, commas, colons, semi-colons,
parenthesis, or brackets can be used as well) between data fields.

Many data files will contain fixed fields.  There are several reasons
you may want or need to take advantage of these fixed fields rather
than using a free format read.

   1. If your data fields do not contain spaces (or some other
      delimiter) between data columns, you need to tell
      Dataplot how to interpret the columns.

   2. In some cases, you may only want to read selected
      variables in the data file.

   3. Using a formatted read can significantly speed up the reading
      of the data.  If you have small or moderate size data files (say
      500 rows or fewer), this is really not an issue.  However, if you
      are reading 50,000 rows, you can significantly speed up the read
      by specifying the format.

   4. If the data fields have unequal lengths, Dataplot will not
      interpret the data file correctly with a free format read.
      It assigns the data items in the order they are encountered
      to the variable names in the order they are given.  Dataplot
      does not try to guess if a data item is missing based on the
      columns.

      The issue of unequal lengths is discussed in detail in the
      next section.

There are two basic cases for fixed fields.

   1. The data fields are justified by the decimal point.

      In this case, you can use the 

          SET READ FORMAT  <format>

      command to specify a Fortran-like format to read the file.
      Enter HELP READ FORMAT for details.

      Using a formatted read is significantly faster than a
      free format read.

   2. Many programs will write ASCII files with fixed columns,
      but the data fields will be either left or right justified
      rather than lined up by the decimal point.

      In this case, you can use a special form of the
      COLUMN LIMITS command that was introduced with the
      January, 2004 version.  Normally, the first and last columns
      to read are specified.  However, you can now enter variables for
      the lower and upper limits as in the following example:

         LET LOWER = DATA  1  21   41
         LET UPPER = DATA 10  30   50
         COLUMN LIMITS LOWER UPPER

      That is, if variables rather than parameters are specified,
      separate column limits are specified for each data field.
      In this case, the first data field is between columns
      1 and 10, the second field is between columns 21 and 30, and
      the third field is between 41 and 50.

      When this syntax is used, only one variable is read for
      each specified field.  If the field is blank, then this is
      interpreted as a missing value.


READING VARIABLES OF UNEQUAL LENGTH (EMPTY FIELDS)

Dataplot typically expects all variables to be of equal length.  That is,
the data is rectangular with no empty fields.

Performing free format reads with space delimited data files when there
are empty fields is problematic.  Dataplot reads the file one row at a
time.  When reading a row, Dataplot will assign the first value read to
the first variable name, the second value to second variable and so on.
By default, the row with smallest number of values defines the number of
variables that will be read.  For example, if you requested four
variables be read, but one row of the data file only has two values, then
only two variables will be read into Dataplot.

If you have a data file where the columns have unequal lengths (i.e.,
empty fields), you can try one of the following things.

    1. Pick some value to represent a missing value and fill
       in missing data points with that value.  After reading
       the data, you can use a RETAIN command to remove them.
       For example, if you use -99 to signify a missing value,
       you can enter

          RETAIN Y SUBSET Y > -99

       Alternatively, you can use a SUBSET clause on subsequent
       plot and analysis commands.

       There are two SET commands that pertain to missing values.

            i. SET DATA MISSING VALUE <value> specifies a character
               string that will be interpreted as a missing value in the
               data file (this character string can be a numeric value).

           ii. SET READ MISSING VALUE <value> specifies the numeric value
               that will be saved to the Dataplot variable when a missing
               value (as defined by the SET DATA MISSING VALUE) is
               encountered.

       When feasible, this is the recommended solution.

    2. If your data file has consistent formats for the rows,
       then there are two possible solutions.

         i. If the fields are justified by the decimal point so that a
            Fortran format statement can be applied, then you can use the
            SET READ FORMAT command.  In this case, empty fields are read
            as zero.  If zero can be a valid data value for one or more of
            your variables, then it can be ambiguous whether a zero in your
            variable denotes a valid data point or a missing value.  The
            SET READ MISSING VALUE setting does not apply when the
            SET READ FORMAT is used.

        ii. Many spreadsheets have an option for saving data to a "fixed
            width" ASCII text file.  In these cases, the fields are
            typically either right or left justified.  However, the column
            for the decimal point will not be consistent so that the
            SET READ FORMAT command cannot be used.  In this case, you can
            use the variable form of the COLUMN LIMITS command as
            described above.  By default, when a blank field is
            encountered, it is set to zero.  You can specify the
            value to use by entering the command

              SET READ MISSING VALUE  <value>

    3. If your data has both columns of unequal length and
       inconsistent columns for given data fields, an alternative
       is to use a comma delimited data file.  If there is no data data
       between successive commas, this is treated as a missing value.
       The default is to assign a value of zero.  Alternatively, you
       can use the SET READ MISSING VALUE command described above.

       You can specify a delimiter other than a comma with the
       command

          SET READ DELIMITER <character>

    4. You can use the following command

           SET READ PAD MISSING COLUMNS ON

       When this command is used, if the number of values read on a row
       is less than the number of variables specified, then the
       values from the row are padded with missing values (as
       specified by the SET READ MISSING VALUE).  For example, if
       you entered

           READ FILE.DAT X1 X2 X3 X4

       and a particular row only had two values, then the first value
       will be assigned to X1 and the second value to X2.  X3 and X4
       will be assigned the missing value for that row.

       This works if the empty fields are at the end.  However, if
       the empty fields are not at the end, then the assignment of
       the data to the variables will not be what is expected.  In
       this case, it is recommended that empty fields be coded with
       a missing value code.

       NOTE: The default (SET READ PAD MISSING COLUMNS OFF) action
             was modified 2019/04.  Previously, if this was off,
             the number of variables read was truncated to the
             number of values on the row(s) with the smallest number
             of values.  This was changed so that the behavior of
             the OFF setting is similar to the ON setting.  The
             difference is that for OFF, a warning message will be
             printed for rows that have fewer than the expected
             number of values.

The variable form of the COLUMN LIMITS, the SET READ MISSING VALUE, and
the SET READ DELIMITER commands were introduced in the January, 2004
version.  The interpretation of successive commas as a missing value was
also introduced in the January, 2004 version.


READING DATA WITH CHARACTER FIELDS

Dataplot has not previously supported character data.  The one
execption is that you could read row labels with the READ ROW LABEL
command (enter HELP READ ROW LABEL for details).  If encountered,
Dataplot would generate an error message and not read the data file
correctly. 

With the January 2004 version, we have introduced some limited
support for character data.  Specifically, we have added the command

     SET CONVERT CHARACTER <ON/IGNORE/ERROR>

Setting this to ERROR will continue the current Dataplot action of
reporting character data as an error.  This is recommended for the
case when a file is suppossed to contain only numeric data and the
presence of character data is in fact indicative of an error in the
data file.

Setting this to IGNORE will instruct Dataplot to simply ignore any
fields containing character data.  This can be useful if you simply
want to extract the numeric data fields in the file without
entering COLUMN LIMITS or SET READ FORMAT commands.

Setting this to ON will read character fields and write them to the
file "dpzchf.dat".  Note that Dataplot saves numeric data
"in memory" for fast access.  Since character data has limited
use in Dataplot, we have decided to save character data 
externally to minimize memory requirements.  Dataplot keeps a
separate name table for the character data fields (the names for
character variables are stored in the file "dpzchf.dat").

NOTE 2018/10: The CATEGORICAL option was added.  This option works
              similarly to ON.  However, in addition to creating the
              character variable in "dpzchf.dat", it also creates
              numerical variables automatically from the character
              data.

There are some restrictions on when Dataplot will try to
read character data:

   1) This only applies to the variable read case.  That
      is, READ PARAMETER and READ MATRIX will ignore
      character fields or treat them as an error.

   2) Dataplot will only try to read character data from
      a file.  When reading from the keyboard (i.e., when
      READ is specified with no file name), character data
      will be ignored when a SET CONVERT CHARACTER ON is
      specified.

   3) This capability is not supported for the SERIAL READ
      case.

   4) The SET READ FORMAT command does not accept the
      "A" format specification for reading character
      fields.

   5) A maximum of 20 character variables will be saved.

   6) A maximum of 24 characters for each character variable
      will be saved.

   7) The character variables from at most one data file
      will be saved in a given session.

Some of these restrictions may be addressed in subsequent
releases of Dataplot.

Currently, Dataplot has limited support for character variables.
Specifically,

   1) The row label can be used for the plot character by
      entering the command

        CHARACTER ROWLABEL

   2) You can convert a character variable to a coded numeric
      variable with the command

        LET Y = CHARACTER CODE IX
        LET Y = ALPHABETIC CHARACTER CODE IX

      with IX denoting the name of the character variable.  These
      command assigns a numeric value for each unique name in
      the character variable.

      For the CHARACTER CODE case, the coding is from 1 to K where
      K is the number of unique values.  The order is based on
      the order these values are found in the file.

      For the ALPHABETIC CHARACTER CODE case, the coding is from
      1 to K where K is the number of unique values.  The order is
      performed in alpabetical order.

We anticipate additional use of character variables in subsequent
releases of Dataplot.

If your character fields contain non-numeric/non-alphabetic characters,
then it is recommended that the character fields be enclosed in
quotes.  When Dataplot encounters a quote (either a single or double
quote), it interprets everything until a matching quote is found
as part of that character field.  If the quotes are not used,
then spaces, tabs, parenthesis, brackets, colons, and semi-colons
are interpreted as delimiters that signify the end of that data item.


READING ROW ORIENTED DATA

Dataplot assumes a column oriented format.  That is, a row of
data represents a single record (or case) and a column of data 
represents a variable.  If a data file has a row orientation, then
this is reversed.  A row of data represents a variable and a column
of data represents a record (or case).

The following example shows one way of correctly reading the data
into Dataplot.  Suppose that your data file contains five rows with
each row corresponding to a single variable.  You can do the following:

   LOOP FOR K = 1 1 5
      ROW LIMITS K K
      SERIAL READ FILE.DAT  X^K
   END OF LOOP

NOTE 2018/10: Dataplot added a READ ROW command that will read each row
              into a separate column.  This command assumes all of the
              data in a given row are numeric.  It does not assume that
              all rows must contain the same number of elements.

COMMENT LINES IN DATA FILES

It is sometimes convenient to include comments in data files.
If these comments are contained at the beginning of the file, then
the SKIP command can be used.  To have Dataplot check for comment
lines in the data file, enter the command

    COMMENT CHECK ON

The default comment character is a ".".  That is, any line starting
with a ". " is treted as a comment line and ignored.  To specify
a different comment character, enter the command

    COMMENT CHARACTER  <char>

with <char> denoting the desired comment character.


EXCEL FILES

At the current time (2004/01), Dataplot does not support the
direct reading of Excel data files.  We are planning to add
this capability in a future release of Dataplot.  Until that
time, you need to save the data in Excel to an ASCII file and
read that ASCII file into Dataplot.
 
Excel provides the following options for writing ASCII data
files:

  1. Formatted text (space delimited) (.PRN extension)

     This format will use consistent columns for the data fields.
     The variable form of the COLUMN LIMITS command can be used
     when the data columns have unequal length.

     Character fields will often not have the separating space.  The
     variable form of the COLUMN LIMITS command can be used in this
     case as well.

  2. CSV (Comma delimited) (.CSV extension)

     This format will separate data fields with a single comma.
     Missing data is represented with successive commas.  Dataplot
     can now (as of the January 2004 version) handle this correctly.

  3. Text (Tab delimited) (.TXT extension)
     Text (MS-DOS) (.TXT extension)

     These files will separate data fields with a tab character.
     Note that Dataplot converts all non-printing characters
     (including tabs) to a single space character.

     This format is not appropriate for data containing variables
     with unequal lengths since it will not generate consistent
     columns for the data fields.  Use either the space delimited
     or comma delimited file for that case.

The 2014/12 version of Dataplot added the capability of reading
and writing to the system clipboard under Windows.  Using the
"copy" function and Excel and then using the READ CLIPBOARD command
in Dataplot will in many cases be the easiest way to retrieve
data from Excel files.  Enter HELP CLIPBOARD for details.

Note 2020/08: Dataplot added a READ EXCEL command.  This command
utilizes Python (and specifically the Pandas package) to read Excel
files.  Enter HELP READ EXCEL for details.

FILE NAME RESTRICTIONS

A few comments on file names.

  1. File names are limited to 80 characters or less (this includes
     the path name if given).

  2. If the file name contains either spaces or hypens, it
     should be enclosed in double quotes.  For example,

       READ "C:\My Documents\SAMPLE.DAT"  Y X1 X2

  3. The file name should be a valid file name on the local
     operating system.

  4. The file name must contain a period "." in the file name itself
     or as a trailing character.  Dataplot strips off trailing periods
     on those systems where it is appropriate to do so.  On systems
     where trailing periods can be a valid file name (e.g., Unix),
     Dataplot opens the file with the trailing period.
 
  5. On systems where file names are case sensitive (i.e., Unix),
     Dataplot first tries to open the file name as given.  If the
     file is not found, it then tries to match the file name
     after converting the name to all upper case characters.  If
     it is still not found, it will convert the file name to all
     lower case characters

     If your file name contains a mixture of upper and lower case
     characters, then you need to enter the case for the file name
     correctly on the READ command.


COMMA AS DECIMAL POINT

Dataplot follows the United States convention where the decimal
point is the period ".".  Some locales may use a different
character to denote the decimal point.  In particular, some
countries use the comma ",".

To allow Dataplot to read files that use a character other than
the "." for the decimal point, enter the command

     SET DECIMAL POINT <value>

where <value> denotes the character that specifies the decimal
point.

Note this support is fairly limited.  Specifically, it applies
to free-format reads (i.e., no SET READ FORMAT command has been
entered).  In addition,

   1. This option is not supported for the WRITE command.  WRITE
      will always use a period for the decimal point.

   2. Dataplot alphanumeric output (e.g., the output from the FIT
      command) is generated with the period as the decimal point.

   3. As mentioned above, if you read your data with a 
      SET READ FORMAT command, the data must use the period
      for the decimal point.


MISSING VALUES AND UNDEFINED VALUES

Some software programs will have special characters to denote
missing values or undefined values (e.g., the result of trying
to divide by 0).

In particular, Unix/Linux software often uses "nan" to denote an
undefined number.  If Dataplot encounters an "nan" in a numeric
field, it will convert it to the Dataplot "missing value".  The "nan"
search is not case sensitive (i.e., it will check for "NAN", "NaN",
etc.).  You can specify what Dataplot will use for the missing value
by entering the command

    SET READ MISSING VALUE  <value>

where <value> is a numeric value.

Missing value flags are specific to individual programs.  You can
specify a character string that denotes a missing value with the
command

    SET DATA MISSING VALUE <value>

where <value> is a string with 1 to 4 characters.  If Dataplot
encounters <value> in a numeric field, it will convert it to the
Dataplot "missing value".  The missing value string is not case
sensitive.  You can specify what Dataplot will use for the missing
value by entering the command

    SET READ MISSING VALUE  <value>

where <value> is a numeric value.

READING DATE AND TIME FIELDS

Date and time fields will typically have syntax like

   2016/06/22
   12:43:08

Dataplot treats the "/" and ":" as indicating character fields
(based on the SET CHARACTER CONVERT command, this will either cause
an error, result in this field being ignored, or the field being
read as a character variable).

The following commands were added (2016/06) to help deal with date and
time fields.

   SET DATE DELIMITER <character>
   SET TIME DELIMITER <character>

Although Dataplot does not have explicit date or time variables,
these commands allow the components of date and time fields to
be read as separate numeric variables.  For example,

   SET DATE DELIMITER /
   SET TIME DELIMITER :
   READ YEAR MONTH DAY HOUR MIN SEC
   2016/06/22  23:19:03
   END OF DATA

READING IP ADDRESSES

IP addresses typically have a syntax like

   129.6.37.209

By default, Dataplot will generate an error when trying to read a
field of this type.  To address this, you can enter the command

   SET READ IP ADDRESSES ON

If this switch is ON, Dataplot will scan the line and if a field is
encountered that conains more than one period ".", Dataplot will
convert these periods to spaces before parsing the line.

The default is OFF since this adds additional processing time to
the READ and most data sets do not contain IP addresses.

READING MONETARY DATA

Monetary data may sometimes be given as

   $11,456.12  $1,021,111.10

The "$" and "," in these numeric fields will cause problems.  The
"$" will be treated as a non-numeric value (depending on other
SET commands, this will be treated as an error or the numeric field
will be read as a character field).  The comma is typically treated
as a field delimiter.  If you have this kind of data, enter the
commands

    set read dollar sign ignore on
    set read comma ignore on

To reset the defaults, enter

    set read dollar sign ignore off
    set read comma ignore off

Note that if you enter the SET READ COMMA IGNORE ON command, the
comma will no longer be treated as the delimiter.  Dataplot cannot
currently handle the case where the comma is used both for monetary
data and also as a field delimiter.

READING NUMERIC VALUES WITH TRAILING "+" OR "-"

On occassion, numeric fields may have a trailing "+" or a
trailing "-".  The "+" is typically used to indicate that the
value is greater than or equal to the entered value.  Likewise, the
"-" is used to indicate that the value is less than or equal to the
entered value.  This may be used when data is truncated at a high
or low value.  If you have data that uses this convention, enter

    set read trailing plus minus ignore on

Dataplot does not have any convention for indicating that a number
in fact means "greater than" or "less than", so it will read the
numeric value and simply ignore the "+" or "-".

To reset the defualt, enter

    set read trailing plus minus ignore off

COMMAS WITHIN CHARACTER FIELDS

If you are reading data that may contain character fields, you can
specify whether you want commas in the character fields to be
treated as part of the character field or as a delimiter.

To have the comma treated as a delimiter, enter

    set character field comma delimiter on

To have the comma not be interpreted as a delimiter (i.e., it
will simply be another character in the character field), enter
 
    set character field comma delimiter off

The default is OFF.

READING BINARY DATA

Currently, the only types of binary data that Dataplot currently
supports are:

  1) A few types of image files can be read on some platforms.
     This is discussed in the next section.

  2) Dataplot may be able to read some files created using Fortran
     unformatted data files.  Dataplot is most likely to have success
     reading unformatted Fortran files that contain only numeric data
     and use a consistent record structure.  Unformatted Fortran
     files that contain a mixture of character and numeric data
     will not be read successfully.

Support for other types of binary files may be added in future
releases.  However, this support will probably be for specific
types of binary files as oppossed to arbitrary binary files.

The advantage of using unformatted Fortran files is that file sizes
may be significantly smaller and reading the data can be significantly
faster.  One potential use of unformatted Fortran files is to save
a large data file that you will read many times in Dataplot.

The disadvantages of using unformatted Fortran files are that they
are not human readable, they cannot be edited or modified using an
ASCII editor, and, most importantly, they are not portable between
operating systems and compilers.  That is, unformatted Fortran files
typically need to be read using the same operating system and compiler
that was used to create them.

For details on using unformatted Fortran files, enter

     HELP SET READ FORMAT


READING IMAGE DATA

If Dataplot was built with support for the GD library, Dataplot
can read image data in PNG, JPEG, or GIF format.  If you have
image data in another format, you may be able to use an image
conversion program (e.g., NetPMB or ImageMagick) to convert it
to one of the supported formats.

For further information, enter

    HELP READ IMAGE


WHAT IF ALL THE DATA WILL NOT FIT INTO MEMORY?

Dataplot was designed primarily for interactive usage.  For this reason,
it reads all data into memory.  The current default is to have a
workspace that accomodates 10 columns with 1,500,000 rows (you can
re-dimension to obtain more columns at the expense of fewer rows, however
you cannot increase the maximum number of rows).

With the advent of "big data", there are more data files that cannot be
read into Dataplot's available memory.  For these data files, there are
several things that can potentially be done

   1. For some platforms, if you have a large amount of memory you may
      be able to build a version of Dataplot that raises the maximum
      number of rows.  For example, on a Linux system with 64MB of RAM,
      we were able to build a version that supports a maximum of
      10,000,000 rows.  Contact Alan Heckert if you need assistance
      with this.

   2. The STREAM READ command was added.  This command uses one pass
      algorithms to do a number of things.

      a. You can create a new file that uses SET WRITE FORMAT.  This
         is typically done once so that you can use SET READ FORMAT on
         subsequent reading of the data file (this can substantially
         speed up processing of these large files).

      b. You can generate various summary statistics either for the full
         data set or for groups in the data.

      c. You can generate cross tabulation statistics (up to 4
         cross tabulation variables may be specified).

      d. You can create various types of distance (e.g., Euclidean
         distances, correlation distances) matrices either for the full
         data set or for cross tabulations of the data.
 
         Distance matrices are often used for various types of
         multivariate analysis.

      e. You can generate approximate percentiles either for the full
         data set or for cross tabulations of the data.  Based on this,
         you can perform distributional modeling for a single variable
         or distributional comparisons between variables (e.g.,
         quantile quantile plots, bihistograms, two sample KS tests, and
         so on).

      The STREAM READ command can allow you to do a fair bit of
      exploratory analyses on these large data sets.

-------------------------  *SYSTEM LIMITS*  ----------------
 
SYSTEM LIMITS
SYSTEM LIMITS
 
This section documents some relevant limits when using Dataplot.
Note that many of these limits can be set (in the file DPCOPA.INC)
before Dataplot is compiled on a specific system.  The limits below
are the default values, but the limits for your specific system may
be set differently.


  1) MAXOBV   = 2,000,000

     Defines the maximum number of observations for a single
     variable.  This is the parameter most likely to be modified
     before Dataplot is compiled.  It will typically be in the
     range 100,000 to 2,000,000.

  2) MAXOBW   = 10*MAXOBV

     Defines the total size of the data work space.  Note that
     the DIMENSION command can be used to re-allocate between
     rows and columns with the restriction that the maximum
     number of rows cannot exceed MAXOBV.

  3) MAXPOP   = 2*MAXOBV

     Defines the maximum number of points on a plot.
  
  4) MAXNME   = 50000

     Define the maximum number of pixmaps that can be saved.

 13) MAXTOM   = 46*MAXOBV/3

     Define the maximum size (rows times columns) for a matrix.
     Note that the DIMENSION MATRIX command can be used to
     specify the allocation between rows and columns in the matrix.

 14) Define the following plot control component dimensions:

     MAXTC    = 100    = the maximum number of tic marks on an axis.
     MAXLG    = 100    = the maximum number of legends.

-------------------------  *DISTRIBUTIONS*  -----------------
 
PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS
Probability Distributions
 
The following commands operate on distributions:

    <dist> PROBABILITY PLOT
    <dist> <PPCC/ANDERSON DARLING/KOLM SMIR/CHI-SQUARE> PLOT
    <dist> <ANDERSON DARLING/KOLMOGOROV SMIRNOV/CHI-SQUARE/PPCCC>
           GOODNESS OF FIT
    LET Y = <dist> RANDOM NUMBERS FOR I = 1 1 N
    BOOTSTRAP <dist> <MLE/PPCC/ANDERSON DARLING/KOLM SMIR> PLOT
    JACKNIFE <dist> <MLE/PPCC/ANDERSON DARLING/KOLM SMIR> PLOT

For these commands, you may need to enter value of one or more
shape parameters and/or values for location and scale parameters.
For example,

   LET GAMMA = 2.5
   WEIBULL PROBABILITY PLOT Y

More specifically:

   1) For the RANDOM NUMBERS command, you need to specify the values
      of any shape parameters.  This command does not utilize location
      or scale parameters.  However, you can transform the random
      numbers using the relation

          Y = LOC + SCALE*Y

      For example,

          LET GAMMA = 2.5
          LET LOC = 10
          LET SCALE = 5
          LET Y = WEIBULL RANDOM NUMBERS FOR I = 1 1 N
          LET Y = LOC + SCALE*Y

   2) For the PROBABILITY PLOT command, you need to specify the
      values for any shape parameters.  For example,

          LET GAMMA = 2.5
          WEIBULL PROBABILITY PLOT Y

      You can optionally specify location and scale parameters with
      the commands

          LET PPLOC = <value>
          LET PPSCALE = <value>

      Note that the probability plot is invariant to location and
      scale (i.e., the linearity of the probability plot does not
      depend on the values of the location and scale parameters).
      PPLOC and PPSCALE are typically used when a non-PPCC method
      is used to estimate the location/scale parameters.
      
   3) For the PPCC PLOT, ANDERSON DARLING PLOT, KOLMOGOROV SMIRNOV PLOT
      and CHI-SQUARE PLOT commands, you can optionally specify the
      range for the shape parameter(s) (default ranges will be used if
      they are not specified).  For example,

          LET GAMMA1 = 0.5
          LET GAMMA2 = 5
          WEIBULL PPCC PLOT Y

      That is, you append a 1 (for the lower limit) and a 2 (for the
      upper limit) to the shape parameter name.

      For the ANDERSON DARLING, KOLMOGOROV SMIRNOV, and CHI-SQUARE
      variants, you can optionally fix the values of the location/scale
      parameters with the commands

          LET KSLOC = <value>
          LET KSSCALE = <value>

   4) For the GOODNESS OF FIT and the BOOTSTRAP/JACKNIFE PLOT commands,
      you need to specify the values for any shape parameters.

      In addition, you can specify the values for the location/scale
      parameters with the commands (these will default to 0 and 1
      if these commands are not given)

          LET KSLOC = <value>
          LET KSSCALE = <value>

      Distributions that are bounded both above and below specify
      the lower and upper limits (rather than the location/scale)
      with the commands

          LET A = <value>
          LET B = <value>

      Distributions that use A and B rather than KSLOC/KSSCALE will
      be denoted by the phrase "bounded distribution" in the tables
      below.

      An example of using these commands:

          LET GAMMA = 2.5
          LET KSLOC = 5
          LET KSSCALE = 10
          WEIBULL ANDERSON DARLING GOODNESS OF FIT Y
          BOOTSTRAP WEIBULL ANDERSON DARLING PLOT Y

The extreme value type 1 (Gumbel), extreme value type 2 (Frechet),
generalized Pareto, generalized extreme value and the Weibull
support "minimum" and "maximum" forms of the distribution.  You
can specify the minimum form with either of the following commands

    SET MINMAX 1
    SET MINMAX MINIMUM

You can specify the maximum form with either of the following commands

    SET MINMAX 2
    SET MINMAX MAXIMUM

The default is the "minimum" for the Weibull and "maximum" for the
others.

This section documents the values you need to enter for the distributions
supported in Dataplot.
