Yellow Bopok (may 1993) Plots
Bone dosimetry via re-irradiation of bone specimens
David Schauer
January 1993
Number of observations = 6
Number of variables per line image = 2
Order of variables on a line image--
   Y = Signal Intensity (divided by 1000) of the EPR Spectrophotometer
   X = Added Irradiation Dose (in Grays)
Note--
   The device is an EPR Spectrometer.
   The sample is placed in a strong magnetic field.
   Sweep through sample with magnetic fields of varying strength.
   This induces monochromatic microwaves.
   The spectrometer measures the energy absorbed.
   The energy absorbed is proprotional to radiation dose in the bone.
   The vertical axis signal intensity value
   (0 to 100,000 coded here as 0 to 100)
   is the peak to value intensity of the first derviative (with respect
   to the magnetic field) of the absorption curve.
   The raw signal has not yet been adjusted for mass, dose, or
   number of scans.
