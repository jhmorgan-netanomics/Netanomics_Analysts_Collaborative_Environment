Response variable   = Accelerated life test on the corrosion resistance
                      of a multilayer coating (life = sum of coating
                      lives)
Censoring variable  = 1 implies failure time, 0 implies censor time
Number of observations = 14
Number of observations per line image = 2
Order of observations per line image--
   1. Response variable
   2. Censoring variable
