This is Dataplot data file    FUNNEL5C.DAT
Simulated 2-experiment Funnel data
(same as FUNNEL12.DAT except here split into 2 columns)
Number of observations             = 5
Number of variables per line image = 2
Order of Variables on a line image--
   1. Response variable 1 = traversal time (pre-mod)
   2. Response variable 2 = traversal time (post-mod)
