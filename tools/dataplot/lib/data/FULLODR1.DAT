This is the Dataplot data file        FULLODR1.DAT
This is the data set from page 230 - 238 of Wayne Fuller's
book "Measurement Error Models", John Wiley, 1987.
This is one of the data sets used in the version 2.01 ODRPACK manual.
We have included it here to calibrate the Dataplot implementation
of the ODRPACK package.  Data are the percent saturation of
nitrogen gas in a brine solution forced into the pores of
sandstone and the observed compressional wave velocity of 
ultrasonic signals propogated through the sandstone.
The proposed model is:
    Y = B1 + B2*[EXP(B3*X) - 1]**2
Contact--Alan Heckert, NIST
Number of observations                       = 12
Number of observations per line image        = 2
Order of variables on a line image--
   1. Factor Variable X     = Compression Velocity
   2. Dependent Variable Y  = Percent Saturation
