Response Variable                  = flavor rating
Number of observations             = 5
Number of variables per line image = 3
Order of variables per line image--
   Response variable = lemon flavor rating (large => good)
   Factor 1          = juice A proprotion (0 to 1)
   Factor 2          = juice B proprotion (0 to 1)
Project Question--What settings for the 2 ingredients
                  maximize the lemonade flavor rating?
