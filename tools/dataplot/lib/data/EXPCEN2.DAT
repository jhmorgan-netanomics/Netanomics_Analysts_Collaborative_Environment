Sample data set from Example 12.4 of
Karl Bury, "Statistical Distributions in Engineering",
Cambridge University Press, 1999, pp. 203-204.

Response variable   = Redesigned electronic component tested under a
                      multiple of the maximum design voltage, test
                      terminated at 12th failure
Censoring variable  = 1 implies failure time, 0 implies censoring time
Number of observations = 18
Number of observations per line image = 2
Order of observations per line image--
   1. Response variable
   2. Censoring variable
