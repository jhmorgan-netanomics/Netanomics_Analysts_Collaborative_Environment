This is the Dataplot data file        DRAPS521.DAT
This is the data set from exercise I on page 521 of
Draper and Smith "Applied Regression Analysis: 2nd Edition".
This is the data used in the ODRPACK manual as a sample.  We
have included it here to calibrate the Dataplot implementation
of the ODRPACK package.  Data are from a simulated planned experiment.
The proposed model is:
    Y = EXP{-theta1*X1*EXP[-theta2*((1/X2) - (1/620))]} + E
this other than the data is from a planned experiment.

Number of observations                       = 8
Number of observations per line image        = 4
Order of variables on a line image--
   1. Dependent Variable Y  = fraction of original materail remaining
   2. Factor Variable X1    = reaction time (minutes)
   3. Factor Variable X2    = temperature (degrees Kelvin)
   4. Run Number
