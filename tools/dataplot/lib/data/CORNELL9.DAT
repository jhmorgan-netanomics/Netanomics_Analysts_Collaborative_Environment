Effect of Fish Components on Fish Patties Texture
        3-Factor Unconstrined Mixture

        for Product Quality.  Page 9 (Table 2).
Response Variable                  = fish patties texture
Number of observations             = 6
Number of variables per line image = 4 (= 1 + 3)
Order of variables per line image--
   Response variable 1 = fish patties texture  (replication 1)
   Response variable 2 = fish patties texture  (replication 2)
   Factor 1            = mullet proportion     (0 to 1)
   Factor 2            = sheepshead proportion (0 to 1)
   Factor 3            = croaker proportion    (0 to 1)
Project Question--What settings for the 3 ingredients
                  minimize the fish patties texture?
Statistical area--mixture design of experiment
