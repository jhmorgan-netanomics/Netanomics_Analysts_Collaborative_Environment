Effect of Pesticide Composition on Mite Survival
        3-Factor Unconstrined Mixture Experiment
        Simplex-Centroid
Source--Cornell, John A. (1990).  ASQC Statistics
        Division Volume 5:  How to Run Mixture Experiments
        for Product Quality.  Page 35 (Table 10).
Response Variable                  = mite survival %
Number of observations             = 7
Number of variables per line image = 4 (= 1 + 3)
Order of variables per line image--
   Response variable = mite survival % (small % => good)
   Factor 1          = pesticide component 1 proportion
   Factor 2          = pesticide component 2 proportion
   Factor 3          = pesticide component 3 proportion
Project Question--What settings for the 3 ingredients
                  minimize the mite survival percentage?
Statistical area--mixture design of experiment
