This is Dataplot data file     VANGEL2.DAT
2-sample Coefficient of Variation Example
Mark Vangel, NIST
Question--Do the 2 samples have same relative variation?
 
Response variables = Tension and Shear
Number of observations             = 5
Number of variables per line image = 2
Order of variables on a line image--
   Response variable 1 = specimen tension
   Response variable 2 = specimen shear
Statistical areas--multi-factor analyis (2-sample)
                   multivariate analysis
