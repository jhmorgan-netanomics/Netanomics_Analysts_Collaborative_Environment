This is Dataplot data file    FRECHET.DAT
Sample data set from Example 16.1 of
Karl Bury, "Statistical Distributions in Engineering",
Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 305.

Response variable = Maximum yearly snow load (coded data) on a
                    proposed stadium roof has been calculated on
                    the basis of a 16-year precipitation record
Number of observations = 16
Number of observations per line image = 1
Order of observations per line image--

Bury models this a 2-parameter Frechet (maximum)

Note that observation 15 is given as 28.8 on page
304 but as 25.8 on page 305.  As it appears 25.8 is
used in his calculations, we use that value.
