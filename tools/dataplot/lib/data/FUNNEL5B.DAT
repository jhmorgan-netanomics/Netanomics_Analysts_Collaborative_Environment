This is Dataplot data file    FUNNEL5B.DAT
Simulated 1-factor Funnel data
(same as FUNNEL13.DAT except here Y in 1 column)
Number of observations             = 10
Number of variables per line image = 2
Order of Variables on a line image--
   1. Response variable = traversal time (seconds)
   2. Factor 1 = treatment (2 levels: pre-mode & post-mod)
Reference--DEX notes, Chapter 5: Statistics
           2-sample location  shift testing
