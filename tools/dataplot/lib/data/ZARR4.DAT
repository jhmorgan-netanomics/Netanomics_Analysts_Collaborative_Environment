This is Dataplot Data file    ZARR4.DAT
temperature-voltage calibration curve
 
Goal: Develop a calibration curve so that a user
      can deduce temperature from voltage.
The data below was gotten from NIST
experiments in which
   temperature was set
   voltage was measured
The non-NIST user will
   measure voltage
   and deduce temperature
 
Concern 1: Calibration or inverse calibration?
Concern 2: Linear, quadratic, or sqrt
Concern 3: Is (0,0) a measured point or theoretical?
