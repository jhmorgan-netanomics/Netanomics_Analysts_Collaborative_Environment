Response Variable                  = ?
Number of observations             = 6
Number of variables per line image = 4 (= 1 + 3)
Order of variables per line image--
   Response variable = Y
   Factor 1          = X1
   Factor 2          = X2
   Factor 3          = X3
Project Question--What settings for the 3 ingredients
                  optimize Y?
Statistical area--mixture design of experiment
