Sample data set from Conover (1999), "Practical Nonparameteric
Statistics," Third Edition, Wiley, p. 355.

In this data set, 12 sets of identical twins were given psychological
tests to measure aggression.  Hypothesis of interest is whether first
born twin tends to be more aggressive (higher score indicates more
aggessive).

Number of Observations                  = 12
Number of Observations per line image   = 2
Order of variables on a line image--
    1. Measure for first born twin
    2. Measure for second born twin
