This is the Dataplot data file        DONNELL2.DAT
Volume fraction of nitrogen required to extinguish flame on
the surface of a plastic cylinder.
Contact--Michelle Donnelly, Fire Research Division, BFRL, NIST
Number of observations                       = 21
Number of observations per line image        = 1
Order of variables on a line image--
   1. Dependent variable X = measurements of flux
Analysis:
   This data set is used in conjunction with DONNELLY.DAT.  The
   data in DONNELLY.DAT are used to compute a calibration curve.
   These data consist of new measurements of flux (and we use
   the calibration curve to make estimates and compute standard
   deviations of those estimates).  See
       http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/mpc/section6/mpc65.htm
   for details.
The variable BALL is an additional measurement.  It is
not used in the case study (it is used for plotting).
