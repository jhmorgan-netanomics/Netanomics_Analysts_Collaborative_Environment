                    Dataplot Correction
                 (Versions 92.5 and higher)
 
 
If upon installing Dataplot, you encounter an
immediate I/O error message/bomb when you try to
execute Dataplot, with complaints about files
 
      TCINCF, and
      C:\TURBOC\FRONTEND\DPCOMF.TEX
 
this is due to Dataplot trying to open a file in
the non-existent directory:
 
      C:\TURBOC\FRONTEND
 
This action of subroutine TCINCF to open a file is
in preparation for Dataplot's front end (not yet
released).  To circumvent this error message/bomb,
simply create the missing directory directly via
 
      1) CD ..               go to root directory
      2) MD TURBOC           create directory TURBOC
      3) CD TURBOC           go to directory TURBOC
      4) MD FRONTEND         create subdirectory c:\TURBOC\FRONTEND
 
and then return to the Dataplot directory to
execute Dataplot:
 
      5) CD C:\DATAPLOT      go to directory C:\DATAPLOT
      6) DP                  execute dataplot
 
You should now be able to execute Dataplot normally.
I apologize for any inconvenience.
