                              General Principles of
                        Experiment Design & Data Analysis
 
                                James J. Filliben
 
 
 1. Classical Data Analysis versus EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
       Classical: data --> model* --> analysis --> conclusions
       EDA: data* --> analysis --> model --> conclusions
 
 2. Primary goal of EDA: insight
 
 3. #1 tool of EDA: graphics
 
 4. Plot the raw data
 
 5. EDA is sequential:
       data
       simple statistics
       univariate
       multivariate
 
 6. Essence of analysis (EDA): comparison
    Essence of comparison: juxtaposition
    therefore ==> multiplotting
 
 7. When in doubt: test underlying assumptions
 
 8. A number without an uncertainty is useless
 
 9. Check outliers
 
10. EDA:
       1. check global structure
       2. check fine structure
 
11. To look at fine structure,
    must subtract out global structure first
 
12. Optimal estimator of location    depends
    on the underlying distribution
 
13. Therefore, should "estimate" distribution first
    before choosing location estimator
 
14. Estimate distribution via probability plots
 
15. Plot simple statistics:
       ybar(i) vs i
       sd(i) vs i
 
16. If multidimensional/multi-factors:
    then use
       1. multitrace
       2. line types
       3. character types
       4. color
       5. dynamics
       6. multiplotting
 
17. Global truth <===> subset truth
       If looking to deduce a global truth,
       then must be true over all/most subsets
 
18. If multivariable,
    then look at
       1. within  (absolute)
       2. between (relative)
 
19. For graphics:
       keep data density up
       keep chart junk down
       keep white space down
 
20. In graphics, don't waste white space.
    therefore ==> multitracing & multiplotting
 
21. As the sample size n increases,
    and the number of factors k increases,
    then the importance of graphics increases.
 
22. Goal of quantitative analysis: rigor
    Goal of graphical analysis: sufficiency
                                save time
                                insight
                                structure
 
23. Conjecture:
       If can "prove it" quantitatively,
       then there exist some graph that can
       show/demonstrate it better.
 
24. Value of current computers
    is not fast number-crunching,
    it is  fast graphics.
 
25. Local conclusions need not be true globally, but
    global conclusions must be true locally;
    therefore ==> subset plots
 
26. We can understand univariate structure
    without understanding multivariate structure,
                    but
    we cannot understand multivariate structure
    without understanding univariate structure;
    therefore ==> univariate: do univariate first.
 
27. Analysis is a    comparison    operation--
                     not
    a    memory    operation;
    therefore ==> multiplot plots per page.
 
28. Ideal number of points/page: 1000 to 100,000;
    but typical number is 10 to 100;
    therefore ==> multiplotting
 
29. Which variable to put on horizontal axis:
       1. the one with the most number of levels
       2. the nuisance factor (as in block plot)
 
30. Impediments to structure-extraction: chart junk:
       1. tics
       2. tic labels
       3. dead space between plots
       4. grids
    Bare necessity: data & frames
 
31. Connecting lines or not?
       Do both! (fast graphics)
       Lines: +: emphasize autocorrelation strucutre
              -: impede distributional structure
                    1. randomness*
                    2. fixed distribution*
                    3. fixed location
                    4. fixed variation
 
32. If have a factor with 2 levels, then use
       1. bihistogram
       2. empirical Q-Q plot
       3. Youden plot
 
33. For multivariate, think
       within: fine structure/univariate
                  as well as
       between: global structure/multivariate
 
34. DEX sampling plan
    is more important than
    data analysis (GIGO: garbage in, garbage out)
 
35. Design of Experiment / Data Analysis    Bridge:
                  DEX            DAN
       Problem =========> Data =========> Conclusions
 
36. Assumptions:
       1. Most stat procedures have assumptions,
          validity of engineering conclusions
                   depends on
          validity of underlying assumptions
          therefore ==> test assumptions
       2. identify assumptions:
             1. randomness
             2. fixed distribution
             3. fixed location
             4. fixed variation
       3. if given a choice (always!),
          use those stat procedures
          with fewer (or no) assumptions
             e.g., use block plot rather than ANOVA F test
             e.g., use binomial test rather than normal test
             e.g., plot raw data (no assumptions!)
 
37. Data Analysis Approaches:
       How ensure that our conclusions are
                 not dependent
       on the statistical approach we choose?
 
          1. use data-based procedures only,
             rather than stat-based procedures
             (e.g., average & median)
          2. use graphical procedures involving only data
          3. use procedures with few assumptions
          4. use multiple procedures (at least 2)
          5. use assumption-robust / data-resistive procedures
          6. use distributionally-correct procedures
                e.g., average for normal & median for Cauchy
          7. do in proper order:
                check distribution first
                check outliers first & body of data later
                check univariate first & multivariate later
                check subsets first & global later
                   (data analysis itself is an ordered operation)
 
38. Valid conclusions:
       Bridge:
                             DEX          Data analysis
          problem & goal ===========> data ==========> conclusion
                             construct exp.
 
39. Valid Conclusions:
             = f(problem & goal,
                       crisply stated
                       well-defined scope
                       DEX/goal pigeonhole
                 DEX (= design of experiment),
                       choice of DEX: orthogonal
                                      randomization
                                      replication
                                      blocking
                                      use of a control
                                      frequent calibration/SRM
                       hardware/equipment
                       materials
                       measuring devie
                       software/experimentation method
                       environment
                       factory/site
                       how conduct the experiment
                       DEX pigeonhole
                 data,
                       outliers
                 DAN (= data analysis technique),
                       power of statistical procedures
                       correctness of statistical approach
                       validity of statistical assumptions
                       assumption-robust / outlier-resistive
                       software
                       statistician    )
 
40. What DEX (design of experiment) to use
       depends on
    goal pigeonhole
 
41. What DAN (data analysis technique) to use
       depends on
    goal pigeonhole
 
42. If starting with a data set,
    then must define    goals   first
    (how do we know when we're done?)
    before get bogged down
    by the details of the data analysis technique
 
43. To do goal pigeonholing--
       make a multiple-choice
       "walk away with what" list (of nouns/objects):
           1. a typical value (location parameter) (a number)
           2. a distribution & its parameters
           3. a yes/no statement (a conclusion) as to whether
              an engineering modification (different settings
              of a factor) made a difference/improvement
           4. a ranked list of factors (k factors)
           5. a ranked list of best settings (k numbers)
           6. a function & its parameters
           7. a time series function (in time) & its parameters
 
44. If a list/plot is good,
    then a sorted list/plot is better
    <Pareto Principle>
 
45. DEX & DAN are dictated by    goals & pigeonholing;
    goals & pigeonholing    are dictated by the experimentalist.
    What is the specific goal of the experiment?
 
46. Setting project goals is
            not
    a statistics question
 
47. The primary question to distinguish
    between a    comparative    problem
    versus  a    screening   problem:
       1. Are all factors equally important a priori? yes/no
       2. Do you care if:
             you find differences in factor ...? yes/no
             is factor ... out of control?
             is factor ... a characteristic of the
                (unchangeable) population?
 
48. Goals come first, techniques come later.
 
49. If standing on the desert shore of west Africa,
    must decide first as to goal:
       1. where you want to be at the end
    before you decide whether you need (general techniques) a
       1. desert guide
       2. safari leader
       3. boat captain
    & well before you decide whether you need (detailed techniques) a
       1. camel
       2. machetti
       3. boat
 
50. Primary project goal question:
       How do you know when you are done?
