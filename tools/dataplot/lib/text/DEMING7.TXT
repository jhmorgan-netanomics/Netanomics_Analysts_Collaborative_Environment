   DEMING'S 7 DEADLY DISEASES AFFLICTING INDUSTRY

1. Lack of constancy of purpose to plan product
   and service that will have a market and keep the
   company in business, and provide jobs.

2. Emphasis on short-term profits: short-term
   thinking (just the opposite from constancy of
   purpose to stay in business), fed by fear of
   takeover, and by push from bankers and owners
   for dividends.

3. Personal review system, or evaluation of
   performance, merit merit rating, annual review,
   annual appraisal, for people in management--the
   effects of which are devastating.  Management
   by objectives is the same thing by another
   name.  It is well-known that such a system
   creastes the following problems--

      a) It nourishes a short-term performand;
      b) It annihilates long-term planning;
      c) It demolishes teamwork; nourishes rivalry
         and politics;
      d) It builds fear;
      e) It leaves people bitter, others despondant
         and dejected; unfit for work for weeks after
         receipt of rating;
      f) It encourages mobility of mangement.

4. Barriers that rob the factory worker of his
   pride of workmanship.

5. Failure to adopt a policy of never-ending
   improvement of processes.

6. Hope for quick results (instant pudding).
   Impatience.  Ignorance of the difficulties that
   lie ahead.

7. Use of visible figures for management, with
   little or no consideration of figures that are
   unknown or unknowable.  Must get onto factory
   floor and learn what is going on.
