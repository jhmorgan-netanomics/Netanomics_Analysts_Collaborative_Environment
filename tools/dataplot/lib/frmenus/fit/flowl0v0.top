           Generate Calibration Lines Statistics
           (no run-to-run effect wrt location)
           (no run-to-run effect wrt variation)

    1. do individual fits for each run
    2. compute final intercept and slope as
       average of individual intercepts
       and slopes
    3. report final calibration line
    4. compute sd(intercept) and sd(slope) as
       sqrt(average var(coef)) / sqrt(k)
    5. compute df(int) and df(slope) as
       k*(n-2)
    6. compute residual sd as
       the usual pooled sd
    7. compute df for residual sd as
       k*(n-2)
    8. residual analysis for final calibration line
    9. report final inverse calibration line
   10. report  inv. calibration points table &
       uncertainties by
       (to be done)
