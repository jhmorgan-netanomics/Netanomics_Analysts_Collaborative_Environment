Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression fits the following model:

    Y = A0 + A1*X + A2*X**2 + ... + AN*X**N

N is the degree of the fit.  In practice, linear
and quadratic models are the most common forms
of polynomial regression.  Polynomial fits of
degree higher than 3 are relatively rare.

Dataplot supports polynomial regression up
to 10 degrees.
