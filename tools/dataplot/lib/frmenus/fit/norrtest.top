Testing: Jim Norris Calibration Procedure

1. Model:
     Adequacy of linear model over entire range?
2. Runs:
     Outlying runs?
     Run-to-run effect--shift in location?
     Run-to-run effect--shift in variation?
     Time drift within a run
     Time drift across runs
3. NIST data points:
     Outlying (lack of linear fit) data points (zero?)
