16. Is classical residual analysis essential to DDS?
 
Classical residual analysis is only a tangential
part of DDS required only when outliers are
present.  Since the DDS applications generally
involve modeling very large number of long ``large
sample' classical residual analysis of each would
become a stupendous task.
