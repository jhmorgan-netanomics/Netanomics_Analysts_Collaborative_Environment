10. What underlying assumptions for DDS?
 
The only assumption underlying DDS is that the
data must be an ordered sequence.  Although its
current computer programs are based on equi-spaced
or uniformly sampled data, they can be modified
for non-uniform sampling if the underlying process
is continuous-time (or space).  As stressed in
response to question 4, the paucity of assumptions
is one of commendable features of the method.
