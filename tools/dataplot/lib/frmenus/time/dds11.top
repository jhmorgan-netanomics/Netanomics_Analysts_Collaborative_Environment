----- <~time\dds11.top> DDS FAQ 11 Effect of Outliers on DDS
 
11. How is DDS affected by outliers?
 
As has been pointed out by Barnett and Lewis in
the third edition of their book ``Outliers in
Statistical Data' pub Outliers exist as part of
experimenter's reality and as part of analyst's
inescapable responsibility .
 
Outliers and missing observations in the data will
distort the parameter estimates in DDS and would
require additional computation to identify them
and to minimize their influence.  Outliers in the
residuals require changing the usual norm in model
fitting, and also require considerable additional
computation to correctly recover the resultant
deterministic components.
