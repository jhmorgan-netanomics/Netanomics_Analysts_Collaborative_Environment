----- <~time\dds13.top> DDS FAQ 13 Underlying Models
 
13. What are the underlying models used by DDS?
 
Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models.  The
DDS modeling strategy initially uses a sequence of
ARMA(2n, 2n-1), which arise as a uniformly sampled
form of continuous time, stochastic differential
equations.  The final adequate model may, however,
be of arbitrary moving average order ARMA(n,m).
