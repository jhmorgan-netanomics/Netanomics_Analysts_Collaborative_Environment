Advantages: 2**(k-p) Fractional Factorial Designs
 
1. Small sample size (the most important advantage);
2. Able to estimate main effects & some interactions;
 
3. Yields perfect fit at the design points
4. Is an orthogonal design
5. Estimates are free & clear of one another
6. Accomodates both continuous and discrete factors
