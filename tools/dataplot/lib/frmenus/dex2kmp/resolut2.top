The Resolution
 
The 2**(3-1) design has resolution 3 which means that
some main effects are confounded with 2-term (2 = 3-1)
interactions.  In general, resolution 3 designs are to
be used with extreme caution due to the possibility of
a researcher mistakenly deducing from the analysis that a
main effect is important whereas in reality it may be
a masked 2-term interaction effect which is important.
