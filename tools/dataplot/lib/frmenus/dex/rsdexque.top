Response Surface Design Question

4. If you have just a few (1 or 3)
   factors, and they are continuous, and
   you have no mathematical model in
   hand, but the lead question is "What
   are the best levels of the factors so
   as to attain a maximum (or a minimum)
   of the (unknown) response surface?",
   then you need a Response Surface
   Design.
