Models: Completely Randomized Designs

   Y(i,j) = MU + T(i) + random error

where

   Y(i) is any observation for which X1 = i
   MU is the general location parameter
   T(i) is the effect for being in treatment i

Estimates--

   Est. for MU:   ybarall = the average of all the data
   Est. for T(i): ybar(i) - ybarall
                  ybar(i) = average of all Y for which X1 = i
