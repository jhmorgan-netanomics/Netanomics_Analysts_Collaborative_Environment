Discussion: Latin Square Designs - Advantages
 
The advantages of Latin square designs are:

   1) The use of 2 (or 3 or 4 for the Graeco-Latin designs)
      often reduces the variability of experimental errors
      when compared to a single blocking variable.

   2) They allow experiments with a relatively small number
      of runs.
