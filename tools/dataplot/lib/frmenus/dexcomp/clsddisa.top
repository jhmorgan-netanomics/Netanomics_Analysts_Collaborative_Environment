Discussion: Latin Square Designs - Disadvantages
 
The disadvantages are:

   1) The number of levels of each blocking variable must
      equal the number of levels of the treatment factor.

   2) The Latin square models assumes that there are no
      interactions between the blocking variables and
      between the treatment variable and the blocking
      variable.

   3) The randomization is more complex.
