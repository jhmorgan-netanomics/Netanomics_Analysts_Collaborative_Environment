Experimental Goals: Response Surface Designs

If you have just a few (1 or 3)
factors, and they are continuous, and
you have no mathematical model in
hand, but the lead question is "What
are the best levels of the factors so
as to attain a maximum (or a minimum)
of the (unknown) response surface?",
then you need a Response Surface Design.
