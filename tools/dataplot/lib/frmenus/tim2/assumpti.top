Assumptions: Time Series
 
For a given data set consisting of 2 time series,
2 assumption cases are common:
 
Case 1: White noise (most stringent & least common):
   1. series 1 is white noise
   2. series 2 is white noise
   3. series 1 is independent of series 2
 
Case 2: Stationary (less stringent & most common):
   1. series 1 is stationary
   2. series 2 is stationary
   3. series 1 and 2 are cross-stationary
