Acceleration Models: Regression Models

Althought there are a great number of possible
acceleration models, two of the most common are
the Arrenhius model and the Eyring model.

The Arrenhius model is used when only the thermal
stress is significant.

The Eyring model is used when both thermal and
voltage stresses are significant.
