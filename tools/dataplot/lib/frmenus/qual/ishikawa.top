Ishikawa Diagrams
 
If a defect has been detected, Ishikawa, or
cause and effect diagrams, can be useful tool
for helping to diagnose the cause.

Dataplot provides a menu macro to generate
an Ishikawa diagram.  It can be called by:

    CALL ISHIKAWA.DP

Note that this menu MUST be run from the command
line version of Dataplot.  It will hang the
graphical user interface version.
