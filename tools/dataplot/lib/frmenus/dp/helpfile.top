Dataplot HELP Files
 
These are the 6 ASCII files that Dataplot uses
whenever the analyst enters a HELP command:
 
   DPHE1F.TEX
   DPHE2F.TEX
   DPHE3F.TEX
   DPHE4F.TEX
   DPHE5F.TEX
   DPHE6F.TEX
 
All 6 of these files are ASCII, and so--outside of
Dataplot--the analyst may choose to send these files
to a printer to obtain a complete hardcopy listing.
