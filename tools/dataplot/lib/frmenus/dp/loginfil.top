Dataplot Login Files
 
These are the 2 Dataplot macros that are automatically
executed immediately upon entering Dataplot.
These ASCII files consist of Dataplot commands.
If you wish certain commands to be automatically
executed (e.g., specifying an output device),
then enter the appropriate Dataplot command in
on of these 2 files (usually DPLOGF.TEX).
