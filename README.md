## Requirements

To use the Netanomics Collaborative Environment, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. **Shell Access**: The ability to execute Bash scripts.
3. **x11docker**: For managing X11 forwarding and Xephyr environments. This component is not essential, but facilitates the use of terminal-based tools such as NIST Dataplot.
   - [Install x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker):
     ```bash
     sudo apt install x11docker
     ```
   - Installing x11docker ensures that the dependencies and settings necessary for secure and functional X11 forwarding from within the Docker container are in place.
   - Run the following command to ensure that all of the dependencies are installed and the settings are correct:
     ```bash
     x11docker --xephyr x11docker/xfce xfce4-terminal
     ```
   - To operate the collaboborative environment using remote workflows such as EC2, you do not need x11docker image per se, but you do need its dependencies and settings.
   - After you have confirmed that you can successfully forwarded applications from the container, it's your choice to retain the image.

### `run_with_xephyr.sh`

#### Overview
The `run_with_xephyr.sh` script is designed to facilitate X11 forwarding for graphical applications within the `collaborative-env` Docker container. It uses Xephyr to create an isolated X server environment for the container, ensuring that GUI-based workflows can be displayed on your local machine.

#### Features
- Dynamically assigns an available `DISPLAY` for Xephyr.
- Configures `xhost` to allow host X server connections.
- Launches Xephyr with a resolution of `1280x720`.
- Passes the Xephyr `DISPLAY` and X11 socket to the Docker container.
- Cleans up the Xephyr process when the container exits.

#### Usage
```bash
./run_with_xephyr.sh [container_name]
```
- **`container_name`**: (Optional) Name of the container. Attaches to the container if it is running.

This script runs without additional arguments and automatically configures the Xephyr environment for the container. Ensure that X11 is running on the host system before executing the script.

---
---

### `start_workspace.sh`

#### Overview
The `start_workspace.sh` script initializes the workspace for the `collaborative-env` Docker container. It handles user account setup, Git configuration, and workflow initialization, ensuring a flexible environment for a variety of use cases. This function can both be called by the host functions described previously or used within the container to initiate a workflow.

#### Features
- Configures `git` globally if not already set, prompting the user for `user.name` and `user.email`.
- Checks for the existence of the `netanomics` user and prompts for a new user account if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- Updates RStudio Server configuration for the current or newly created user.
- Initializes the specified workflow (`rstudio`, `jupyter`, or X11 with Openbox).
- Defaults to an interactive shell if no `DISPLAY` is available.

#### Usage
```bash
./start_workspace.sh [workflow]
```
- **`workflow`**: (Optional) Specifies the workflow to start. Accepted values are:
  - `rstudio`: Starts RStudio Server.
  - `jupyter`: Starts JupyterLab.
  - (No argument): Starts an X11 session with Openbox or an interactive shell if no `DISPLAY` is set.

If no arguments are provided, the script attempts to start an X11 session or falls back to a basic shell.

---
## X11 Forwarding & VSCode

### **1. Configure the Display on Your Local Machine**

On your **local machine**, ensure that SSH is configured to forward X11 traffic. Edit or create the `~/.ssh/config` file with the following content:

```plaintext
Host your-ec2-instance-name
    HostName <your-ec2-instance-ip>
    User <your-username>
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
```

Replace the placeholders:
- **`your-ec2-instance-name`**: A friendly alias for your host (e.g., `ec2-host`).
- **`<your-ec2-instance-ip>`**: The public IP address of your EC2 instance.
- **`<your-username>`**: The username for your EC2 instance (e.g., `ubuntu`).

Additionally, add the following conditional export to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file on your local machine to set the `DISPLAY` variable specifically for VSCode's integrated terminal:
```bash
if [[ $TERM_PROGRAM == "vscode" ]]; then
    export DISPLAY=localhost:10.0
fi
```

For **Windows users**, add the following line to your PowerShell profile (e.g., `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`):
```powershell
if ($env:TERM_PROGRAM -eq "vscode") {
    $env:DISPLAY = "localhost:10.0"
}
```

---

#### **Install X11 Tools**
To use X11 forwarding, you will need an X11 server installed on your local machine:
- **Windows**: Download and install [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).
- **macOS**: Download and install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).

Ensure the X11 server is running before starting your SSH session to the host.

### **2. Configure the Display on the Host (EC2 Instance)**

If you are running the **Netanomics Collaborative Environment** on your own EC2 instance, you need to configure the instance to permit X11 forwarding. Follow these steps to ensure proper setup:

#### **1. Update the SSH Daemon Configuration**
On the **EC2 instance**, edit the SSH daemon configuration file located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to enable X11 forwarding. You will need root or sudo privileges to do this:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Ensure the following lines are present and not commented out (remove the `#` if necessary):

```plaintext
X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
X11UseLocalhost yes
```

Save the file and restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

---

#### **2. Allow Local Connections to the X11 Server**
Run the following command to allow local connections to the X11 server:

```bash
xhost +local:
```

To make this setting persistent, you can add it to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
# Allow local connections to the X11 server
if command -v xhost &>/dev/null; then
    xhost +local:
fi
```

---

### **3. Ensuring the Container Display is set to `:102`**

When using `run_with_xephyr`, the container's `DISPLAY` is automatically set to `:102`, ensuring proper X11 forwarding to the Xephyr window. Using the **Docker** and **Dev Containers** extensions in VSCode, you can attach to the container environment. In this case, you may need to run `source /workspace/.vscode/.bashrc` to ensure that the container's `DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly. Alternativey, if you specify the Docker container using the -e argument as shown below, you will avoid this issue.

```bash
docker run -itd \
    --name BEND \
    -p 8787:8787 \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    -v bend_r_packages:/usr/local/lib/R/site-library \
    -v bend_julia_packages:/root/.julia \
    -v bend_python_packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v bend_workspace:/workspace \
    -e DISPLAY=:102 \
     jhm18/netanomics_analysts_collaborative_environment:v1.0 /usr/local/bin/start_workspace.sh
```

A common workflow when working with external environments is to open the container on your local terminal using `run_with_xephyr [container_name]` to initiate a Xephyr display for the container, and then attach VSCode to the container.

#### **Steps to Set the Correct DISPLAY in the Container If Not Already Set**
1. Attach to the container via **VSCode** or your terminal.
2. Run the following command to source the `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   source /workspace/.vscode/.bashrc
   ```

Sourcing this file ensures the `DISPLAY` variable is set correctly for your container. You may also run the following command to confirm the `DISPLAY` value after sourcing:
```bash
echo $DISPLAY
```
The output should be:
```
:102
```
